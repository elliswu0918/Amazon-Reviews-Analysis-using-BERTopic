In addition, the strap handles hit the neck of the instrument and make noise when applying the tremolo effect and these handles were non-removable. Other than that, it is still a very fun instrument but I am quite disappointed in these two faults.

The one downside is that the headphone jack doesn't, as I thought it would, actually send all the audio through the headphones instead of the speakers so you can practice silently; instead, it acts more like a monitor, so the sound plays through both the built-in speaker and the headphones.

They were shocked, but not as much as I was when I realized they had never heard Darth Vader's theme in their entire life.

But that's beside the point. It doesn't seem like it, but the deluxe version of the Otamatone is more than a toy; it's an actual, professional instrument. It can be difficult sometimes to play the exact note that you want, but you actually can produce specific notes on this. In case you're debating between the regular and the deluxe, having the three different octaves and the volume control are definitely good reasons to buy the deluxe. It's quiet enough to play at night without disturbing anyone, yet it can get fairly loud as well. Truly the most entertaining instrument that I've had the pleasure of playing.

It hits all the notes perfectly, and has a much better volume slider than its younger version, not to mention an aux jack. Now that, that is going to allow for me to be the true demon of Odd Instrumental Annoyance

I've been playing cello for a long time, sheesh 25 years now and I went to a violin shop to try bows. I ended up playing wood and carbon fiber and took a much more expensive carbon fiber bow to play/test. I liked it a lot but I am...er... budgety so I ordered this to be able to compare.

This bow has a darker, more muted sound than my wood bow, for sure. For me that was lovely and perfect, because my cello has a very bright resonance, which i love, and the... i wouldn't even call it damping... the... darker overtones really worked nicely. In all honesty the tone was basically indistinguishable from the fancier (more expensive) carbon fiber bow I played. I even did semi-scientific recording tests to see if anyone could hear any difference at all. No difference in tone.

This bow feels chunkier (slightly heavy) but is by no means ""cheap"" heavy. It just isn't an ultra lightweight bow. I have played ultra light weight bows... I don't really like them. So, again, super subjective stuff here.

Lastly the hair is nice and thick and has a beautiful luscious sound, you get that classic very subtle whoosh sound when you change bow directions. I haven't played with a fully haired bow in a long time so it has been heaven.

Ok actually lastly I play a lot a lot of the time and I semi-often play shows in loud venues. Certainly if you need a backup bow or a gig bow this will more than fit the bill. Having destroyed a couple bows playing in clubs when the monitor volume was too low (my rock gigs, not classical heh ;)  I can say this would hold up quite well (kind of a general statement re: carbon fiber). Oh and lastly this is a composite I believe, hence the extra weight (right?).

Anyways. Good bow. Me like.",1,3.28E-306,5.05E-307,5.43E-306,2.04E-306,4.5,77.79,0.284217687,Positive

I did a weight comparison of this bow with my original, generic 'Brazil Wood' bow:
Fiddlerman weight = 82 g, 32 g at the tip and 55g at the frog.
Generic Brazil wood = 74 g, 25 g at the tip and 51g at the frog.
The weights don't add up precisely, because I was not able to measure exactly at the tip or frog, but close.
The center of gravity of the Fiddlerman is 10.5 inches from the end of the frog
The center of gravity of the Brazil wood is 9 5/8"" from the end of the frog.
The Fiddlerman is definitely much stiffer. and is well appointed.

I can compare it to my ""student/starter"" Brazilwood bow that came with my rental, and the only thing I can say is the makers of the brazil wood bow should be arrested for selling that as a cello bow. This bow is so far beyond that, even in my limited experience. It is smooth when pulled over the strings, and yet I can feel it grab. The tone is very full and mellow. I am extremely happy with this bow. My luthier wants me to try a JonPaul Avanti, and has ordered one for me to ""trial"". He believes I will be much happier with it. Well, it is going to have a high bar to compare to this Fiddlerman CF Bow.

I have a blog where I am detailing my progress learning to play the cello and I will be posting a full detailed review of this bow within about a week.

EDIT: I have been using this bow (and my new Codabow Diamond) for about a year now, and I have made a couple videos to show the to playing a simple study for comparison of tone.

This prevents the capo from getting a good grip on the strings and allows them to buzz. Not only that, but without any padding, you are clamping a capo on your instrument without any protection. This can scratch and scar your instrument, so if you have a dulcimer you've invested a lot of money into, this would not be a very good choice. Also, the part of the capo that connects with the adjustment screw is a piece of wood with no protection, simply applying the capo causes damage to the unit. I contacted the manufacturer the day I received the capo. They responded that they sell a lot of these and don't get complaints, but I don't see how that is possible. They refunded my money, but did not want me to send the capo back, which I found odd. I tried to use it a couple of times after this and it actually broke.

Several thoughts:

1) This is the sort of item that strikes me as a perfect ""first experiment"" for those eager to get into DIY electronics but for whatever reason are slightly intimidated with the programming that goes along with a micro-controller like Arduino. It requires a little soldering (own a solder iron) and a breadboard is a definite must, plus a few wires. But other than that, it is a stand-alone product. You can have fun with it without ever getting into Arduino.

2) Sound quality is great considering the price and the USB interface to drop in sound files couldn't be simpler.

3) Finally, and this is important, keep in mind going into it that the trigger pins are actually ""outputs"" and not inputs.... the Vin and Gnd leads on the opposite, upper corner of the board need to be connected to between 3-5v, but after that, all that is required to trigger each sound file is to provide a wire connection it to the bottom GND pin below the trigger pins... I spent way to long trying to activate the sound files by APPLYING voltage to these pins as opposed to simply grounding them.... its a testament to Adafruit engineering I didn't damage the thing.

In any case, highly recommended.",2,1,1.94E-307,3.29E-306,1.81E-306,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.191233333,Positive

However if you are making a simple project that only needs sound you can just wire up buttons to the inputs and this board can be a standalone device. I decided to make a motion activated device that says random quotes from beavis and butthead.

501,501,B0006NDF8A,AW3GID10VX3FB,"I originally started out to buy one for my nephew.
He and his brother have just started taking guitar and bass lessons.
I saw the new Squire that brother had just gotten from mom and dad.  It had a bent tuning peg and the straight 1/4"" end of his guitar cord was already bent.
He didn't have a stand and leaned it against the wall...
You can pretty much guess what happened after that.

I bought the 3 pack, one for my nephew with the new bent up Squire, one for my nephew who just received a new Yamaha bass I bought for him on Amazon and one for me to hold up an acoustic bass guitar I keep in my office for practice.
I already have 4 of these stands that are at least 10 years old.
I've been playing for 50 years and there is nothing worse than being at a gig and seeing your instrument get knocked by some drunk who wants to tell you how great you guys sound, but because my instrument was in the stand, it didn't end up laying on the ground. (This has happened to me before with a stand that didn't have the safety strap.) I've played at some pretty crazy places.
The safety strap works, although I used to think it was a pain to hook it across.  Better to be safe than sorry.
The stand has a broad enough stance and low center of gravity that make it pretty hard to knock over.
The materials are of fine enough quality that I don't worry about the finish being damaged on my instruments, the materials used for construction and the adjustable neck are sturdy enough to support any instrument I've ever had to use.
I'm sure there is going to be someone who doesn't like something about this stand, but I'm not using this stand to jack up my car!
On Stage also makes two other stands that hold multiple guitars.
I personally have no need for these stands but they are models GS7252B-DUO / GS7352B-TRI
This is definitely a MUST HAVE FOR BEGINNERS and has proven itself in professional situations.
It's easy to assemble, it folds into a compact size and at $10.00 a stand, they are well worth the price.",3,0.074011703,0.325215137,0.070380819,0.049864302,4.7,38.95,0.079613442,Neutral

The reason I did this is because while I think both guitar stands are very good, neither is perfect, and it is only natural to compare a new thing to the thing that you already have. But more importantly, it seems to me that these two stands are best suited for different purposes (more on this below). They are the CooCheer brand stand and the On Stage Stands brand. The CooCheer I just got from Amazon, the On Stage Stands I had already bought elsewhere.

Although the video is the same video for both reviews, the following is the written review for the On Stage guitar stand.

PROS:
*Sturdy build
*Folds down and can be dis-assembled into three smaller pieces
*Is a taller stand that provides support to both the body AND neck of the guitar
*Has a height adjustment
*Has a strap that will prevent the guitar from falling should someone accidentally bump into the guitar.

CONS:
*The tripod design is mediocre in terms of stability. The base of this stand is not nearly as stable as the CooCheer design. If pushed hard enough this stand could fall over. I only keep mind against a wall.
*It does not fold down as small or cleanly as the CooCheer
*It is larger than the CooCheer when assembled and folded down.

In conclusion, it seems to me that these two guitar stands are both very good, but they are each best suited to different uses. If you have a standard size 6-string electric or acoustic the CooCheer will work fine for you. If you have a longer/taller than typical 6-sting guitar, or particularly if you need a stand for a bass guitar (taller/longer), then you would be better served getting the On Stage Stands. The CooCheer seems like it would be very well suited for use at a gig or on tour, due to its light weight and the fact that it folds down so small. The On Stage Stands strikes me as something better suited for use in one's home or studio, since it is larger, heavier, and the strap provides a little more protection to keep the guitar from falling over. So deciding which is ""better"" really depends on what you specifically need to use it for. For me, the ideal stand would have some of the traits of each of these. It would have the neck support and strap of the On Stage Stands, while having the more stable base of the CooCheer, and have the ability to fold down as small and cleanly as the Coocheer. Alas, since I don't have the perfect stand I will happily use both of these as needed, for the situations each is best suited.",3,0.003963268,8.42E-05,0.001088797,0.000732028,4.7,38.95,0.165633085,Positive

Its clear that On Stage just wanted to save money with that.  I thought at first I might have a defective unit, but according to all the product pictures this is the design.

Its just an annoying slap in the face from a company that typically provides good quality, affordable accessories. You have to remember that even though the stand is only $12, its going to be used to secure guitars costing up to thousands of dollars.

Will it fall over?
Probably not, but you should never have to worry about that regardless.

I bought this as a ""very good condition"" used purchase, through Amazon, just to save a couple of dollars, and I made a mistake.  It's messed-up.  It looks fine, but it has a severe flaw.  Either it was manufactured incorrectly, or whomever returned it (most likely) stepped on the front legs, or something, because the upright part is almost perfectly vertical, and the bottom holder bars practically tilt downwards, which means if I put my guitar all the way in, it will fall out.  I've got another guitar on it now, but a had to put it in at an angle.  There's no top strap to lock-in the neck, either.  I really was not paying attention.  I threw away the box it came in, too.  Amazon might still take it back, but then I'd have to find a good sized box, probably pay for shipping, etc.  Pita.  I'm going to see if I can bend it back into usable shape.  Fwiw, I do own 4 others of these, that I bought brand new, and they're all fine.  I had previously given this item 5 stars, which a brand new one, manufactured properly, would deserve.  Btw, one newbie mistake people make with this is that the legs have to lock into place.  You have to exert some force to do this, and if you don't, the stand will lean wrong, and be unstable, so if you have one, and have this issue, first make sure the legs are clicked-in all the way.

I like to hang the shoulder strap on the neck yoke, as well as a small drawstring bag for tuner, finger picks, capo, etc. These hang discreetly behind the neck of the banjo and barely show. Please keep in mind that the banjo I am using is the small beginner kind with an open back (pics attached)--a standard banjo is much heavier, but I think it should still be fine, as the angle of the stand isn't too steep.

I think it's due to the fact that the bottom piece that holds the lower half of the guitar is on a sort of swivel that allows it to rock back and forth. It's stable once a guitar is on it but I can't seem to make my guitar perfectly straight up and down. It's one of those things though where it's hard to notice unless you're actually looking for it. Overall good product. Might buy a couple more. Bought for my Gretsch G5420T and one of my Martin guitars. It holds the thinner guitars well such as my fender and my Gretsch (I guess if you consider that a thinner guitar) as well as the thick acoustics.

The Amazon images above are of an On Stage Classic series XCG-4 guitar stand. But there is something wrong here.
What I received is either a cheap knock off, or, On Stage changed their XCG-4 for the worse.

And based on reviewer photos. It appears others have also received a different item then what is pictured above by Amazon. Considering the issues they mention, I am not at all surprised by the issues they are having. This stand is not designed as well as the XCG-4s I know. End caps simply fall off. Neck yoke band strap is different size and not as firm. Body yoke is narrower. There is more play where the Vee groove sits in the bottom tube. Creating more distance for the Tee handle screw to travel in to hold the top tube firmly. T handle knob is smaller.
Added up its not as easy to use.

Best I could find out from On-Stage was that they did change/modify the XCG-4 Classic Stand.

What those changes were, I cant say.

The silver label with silver underline reading; On-Stage only, is the one I am reviewing.

Knowing the previous iteration of this stand, I would not recommend this stand.",3,0.181884107,0.272250137,0.194735908,0.111801446,4.7,38.95,0.123550725,Positive

Thanks to those reviews I don't pick it up with the guitar, I move them separately. I used to set my cheap guitar next to me - against the bed, a table, the couch, whatever, and it would fall over sometimes when bumped lightly. When I bought a good guitar I also got this stand and it works as a safe place to put it nearby between playing, and then move it out of the way when I'm done. So I have to be careful to keep the thin cheap tubing in mind when moving and when placing the guitar in the stand, but other than that it's fine for how cheap it is. It does what it's meant to, hold the guitar.

Double check your guitars finish, some will interact with the foam padding.",3,2.53E-306,1,2.60E-306,1.54E-306,4.7,38.95,0.135416667,Positive

They need to be locked in place for stability and that is very easily done. Although this isn't the very best guitar stand ever, for my son's needs, it works just fine. His guitar fits well and is stable. The stand doesn't slip or slide around and the rubberized material really grips the guitar but doesn't leave any sort of residue behind.

The black foam ones have never degraded. The price was right for a pair, so I ordered them. However, I should have read more reviews on these, as the rear support legs on the XCG4's are WAY too short. One little bump as you brush by, and Crash!/Bang!/Boom! your favorite guitar will go. Stability is non-existent. My old On-Stage stands had a rear support leg that was considerably longer.

I don't know why some people have complained that it's unsteady. What's really illogical is that some of these same people buy a Donner, Mugig, or the like instead. Talk about unsteady! These may look cool, but the problem with low-to-the-ground ""half-stands"" is that they provide ZERO neck support, so it's very easy to knock the guitar sideways.  With my On Stage, I never even use the securing ""rubber band"" that's supposed to keep the guitar from falling out.

Some one-star commenters have complained that the holder arms move/spin around. So what?  Simply make sure they're level when you place your guitar on them, and they won't move. See how that works? Problem solved.  I can think of only three reasons for anybody to write a negative review for this stand:

1) the stand was poorly made of inferior materials or
2) the customer had actually ordered a coffee maker or
3)  idiot user error and/or irrationality.

 Most often, it's reason #3.",3,0.189460156,0.234682008,0.205768168,0.117918306,4.7,38.95,0.008805704,Neutral

Best solution is to keep it in a corner where the wall would keep it from tipping.

The cradle just sits in the main tube and swivels easily

The top tube connects into the bottom tube and a nut in the back holds it. This makes the height on the top cradle easily adjustable

The legs are pop-riveted in and makes it fold easily. MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGS ARE SNAPPED INTO PLACE WHEN OPEN OR THE STAND WILL NOT BE STABLE

The security rubber band keeps the guitar from popping out while carrying it around

The padding on the bars fits well and don't cause the guitar to slip

The feet are rubber and don't make the stand slide around or slip.

I had my beater guitar in this and it has fallen over 5 times. Of those times I bumped it with my hip and it fell over backwards. The other four I simply set my guitar on it and it fell over backwards. Let me explain this, I have had on stage guitar stands like this for over 10 years. I started testing this with my beater I just set the bottom in the cradle and let it go. The stand just falls over with the slight momentum of the neck from one and a half inches.
This happens on carpet and tile but is worse on carpet.
This does not happen with my beat up 7 year old on stage stand, or my other brand. They BOTH have back legs that are longer by at least an inch or two.
It was too cheap to bother sending it back. Ill alter it somehow make it work or put it against a wall. But, i needed a couple more of these, and I will not be buying this brand.
This design is poor
EDIT** I have done some further testing and this is worse with guitars with longer/ heavier necks. The ""beater"" I refer to in my review is an Alvarez Baritone. I tesed this with a lighter big baby Taylor and it takes a bit more force to recreate this but not much. I was going to test it with my Taylor BTO GC which neck weight wise would be in the middle of these two but I had an accident with the baritone falling over and hitting the headstock on the floor before I could catch it, so I am done with testing this. This stand will have to only be for the lighter big baby.

1680,1680,B0006NDF8A,A1NZV5LQMRY23X,"I bought three different guitar stands to compare and keep the one I liked best: the Gator Frameworks GFW-GTR-1000, the Musician's Gear stand, and this one - the On Stage XCG4. Of all three, this one came in second place. For those who want to quickly know the winner, it was the Gator Frameworks GFW-GTR-1000. For those who want more details, read on.

Honestly, the XCG4 and the stand by Musician's Gear are very close by comparison. Their construction is similar, with this one having a slightly thicker neck holder rod and slightly more robust foam rubber. The assembly of this one is also slightly better. There's one more piece of foam on the base holder insertion rod as well. Not sure if that would ever be necessary, but it's nice that someone thought of it, for that extra ""just in case"" protection.

There are only two minor things about this one that weren't as good as the Musician's Gear stand. First, the little tightening screw that holds the neck holder rod in place is a little skimpy. It's small and a little less convenient to grab onto for a quick adjustment. Secondly, the back leg is a little shorter. Oddly enough, however, the overall balance of the XCG4 is better than the Musician's Gear stand. So, perhaps the length of the back leg isn't as important here.

In any case, it gets a slightly better review from me over the Musician's Gear stand, but it really only beat it by a nose. You might get away with taking it on stage, but it would probably serve you best at home, used with a light electric guitar or acoustic... maybe even a bass, but don't quote me on that. For the same money, you're better off with the Gator Frameworks GFW-GTR-1000.",3,0.174312243,0.295682747,0.188486383,0.108817829,4.7,38.95,0.170542636,Positive

 - It is not as stable as one might hope, the base where the guitar goes swivels; which makes for an uncomfortable feeling when laying down my guitars.
 - Setting up the height for the arm was awkward for my acoustic guitar. I have a large guitar so the body kept hitting the top of the stand, I had to move the top to almost the limit of the metal tube, but it worked out. If you have a normal sized guitar it works just fine.
 - The safety rubber at the top of the stand is annoying to keep setting up if you have to take the guitar out all the time. I found that I just don't use it for the guitar I use most regularly.

Other than those small issues I found the stand to be of decent quality. The simplicity and affordability are really the key benefits of this stand.",3,2.39E-306,1,2.33E-306,1.42E-306,4.7,38.95,0.018441938,Neutral

1819,1819,B0006NDF8A,A30DGB2WSSZX2R,"I have a couple of FretRest guitar stands I bought from Guitar Center (HT1010). They're $8 more so I figured these were probably the same thing, probably from the same factory in China, just with a different label. Save $8 why not right? Nope. They probably used about one-third less material so that's where some of that $8 savings came from.

I immediately noticed how much shorter the back/middle leg was compared to the FretRest stand. But then I thought, maybe the FR is just unnecessarily long and this short one might work fine. I put my guitar on it, and pushed it (while holding it) and compared the two, and this one definitely doesn't put up much resistance at all. With a little push the thing will fall right back. The FretRest will actually hold it even with 2-3 times the pressure. That's the biggest problem.

But everywhere else you look, the rubber feet, way smaller, the rubber latch, smaller, even the metal tubing is about one-third smaller.

I have some fairly nice guitars, but even if I just had a basic guitar I probably wouldn't try to save the $8 and put it on this stand. It might be fine, but I'd rather spend an extra $8 and get a stronger stand.

Take a look at the attached photos. The ""On Stage"" one is on the left. The ""FretRest"" from Guitar Center is on the right in all the pictures. And no, I don't work for Guitar Center or even particularly like them, but the stand from them is better than this one.",3,0.175186352,0.281600379,0.19008757,0.1132831,4.7,38.95,0.090813492,Neutral

The rear foot (the shortest one) is too short, making the stand too easy to tip backwards. I have another, similar stand, and it's engineered with a longer rear foot and is therefore much more stable. 2. The bottom brace is too wobbly, making it all too easy for a guitar not perfectly placed in the center (or not shaped perfectly round on the bottom--think Fender) to fall to one side under the weight of gravity.

2016,2016,B0006NDF8A,A239DRRHUIZT5F,"OK I really don't know where to begin with this review, so Ill just say it outright.  THIS STAND IS POORLY DESIGNED, MADE OF CHEAP COMPONENTS, UNSTABLE, UNSAFE, AND SMELLS *** REALLY BAD ***.
I wasn't expecting much at this price point but figured Id at least get a basic functional stand suitable for home use.  This stand however isn't even usable.

First, it doesnt bode well when the first thing you see when opening the box is a PROP 65 sticker. That tells you right away the product contains cancer causing chemicals or substances. That reason alone is enough for me to return it.

Second, did I mention the HORRIBLE SMELL? This stand smells of acrid chemicals. So much so it gave me an instant headache.  My sense of smell is somewhat diminished and to me it was VERY strong. I can only imagine what it must smell like to a person with a normal sense of smell. I bought the double pack so it was double the odor.  I cant believe that with the over 1400 reviews that people aren't mentioning the smell. This cant be an isolated incident. I shouldnt be expected to smell that for a few weeks while who knows what chemicals off gas.

Now about the stand itself. The thing is made from cheap lightweight materials. The design is very unstable.  The rear leg is only 3  long and allows the stand to tip over way too easy. Theres no way Im putting any guitar on it.  For comparison, I have an older Peavey stand and the rear leg on that stand is over 6 inches long.  The nut and screw assembly for tightening the upper yoke to the stand base is a loose fitting pressed in thing that just spells trouble down the road.  The lower yoke that holds the guitar body just slips through a hole punched in the tubing.  No support pieces help to stiffen up the area where the yoke passes through.  Again another area that spells trouble.

I bought these stands based on overwhelmingly positive reviews for this item. I cant believe 69% of people rated this 5 stars.  SMH, I wonder what stand they were talking about because the ones I got are total junk.

Do yourself a favor and avoid these at all costs.  These are being returned and I'll order a different brand and style.",3,1,2.11E-307,3.95E-306,2.05E-306,4.7,38.95,0.017710517,Neutral

Before I just had my guitar in a case leaning against the wall which was fine but by having the guitar in the stand I find that I play it more.

It seems simple enough for a manufacturer such as On Stage but the simplest things aren't so simple. The screw that holds the top arm in place and also allows it to slide if you loosen/tighten it was not properly molded or something so when you tighten it, it turns the top arm left.

The more you tighten it the more it turns. This throws the whole guitar and thus the whole stand off making it no better than standing it up against the wall. I will be returning this and asking for a refund. Quite disappointed, not sure how it had such good reviews.

The height of the neck from the swivel base (not the floor) is adjustable from 21"" up to about 26"" (and still able to use the screw in the back to secure the adjustable neck). The pictures are exactly what you get, so I didn't see the point of taking another picture of the stand.

The two issues I have with this stand is 1. It is in fact very unstable. While it's just sitting around, it's nice and as long as it is out of the way then it's fine. If you barely push it diagonally to the back left or back right, it will easily fall over. If it is sitting in a corner you won't have to worry about it. If it is on a stage, in a more high traffic area, or if there are other items around that could push in to it or if you're in a rush to put it down, dog/kids in house - it could easily fall over. I have mine in a corner like most people probably do, however that's a major concern for a stand. The rear peg is just too short. 2. The pads on the metal aren't very high quality. Although they are fine for light use around the house and will probably last a year or more, they will wear out and need to be replaced for sure. They are not very thick but do the job.

Since the plastic pieces just push on, the typically simply slide on when you are attempting to remove the ""band"" - only they are not supposed to and the plastic piece falls out of the band and rolls around on the flood.

The cradle just sits in the main tube and swivels easily - but this ensures that however you place the guitar on it, it will settle into it.

The top tube insets into the bottom tube and the nut at back holds it in place - this allows you to adjust the height on the top cradle.

The legs are pop-riveted in - that means it folds up easily. NOTE: You have to make sure the legs are snapped into place when open or the stand will not be stable.

I like the security rubber band, it keeps the guitar from popping out while your carrying it around.

The padding on the bars fits well, no slippage.

The feet are rubber, no slip and long lasting. Great bargain here, I really like this stand.",3,0.180402243,0.297321445,0.185441702,0.107700022,4.7,38.95,0.290277778,Positive

2363,2363,B0006NDF8A,A1H19KR3X86SSO,"In the past I've always picked up the FretRest guitar stands from Guitar Center, but since I wasn't in a hurry and didn't feel like driving around town, I ordered this On Stage stand from Amazon, figuring that a guitar stand is a guitar stand.  I have a few other On Stage products (mic boom stand, music stand) and figured this would fit the bill.  Meh.  I set my Strat in the stand and it defaulted to a skewed, off balance position.  The bottom support is apparently thinner and has a different base scale than what I'm used to, so it took a bunch of fidgeting to get the guitar to stand upright.  Same thing with my Les Paul.  With the FretRest stands I can just drop the guitar in the stand, it fits perfectly, done deal.  With this thing I have to mess around with it and move the guitar around until it seats nicely.  Ultimately I ended up using it for my bass guitar (which isn't used nearly as frequently as my other guitars) just because it'll just sit there for the most part.

To be fair, I don't think the guitars are in any danger of falling out of the stand, and it seems sturdy enough, so I'll give it a couple stars for that.  But a guy should be able to just stick his guitar in the stand without having the base support swivel all over the place, skewing to one side, then having the neck rest against the side of the top support instead of against the back.

I have redone this review because I have a complaint.  These are not standardized.  I have five (!) of these stands now, and several of them have different parts.  The part that goes across the top to hold the neck in place especially seems to vary.  My original stand had a good one.  My second stand had a less-good one which broke.  My three new ones, one has the same good one as my first, another the not as good one as my second, and the last one has another entirely that is really difficult to pull across and attach (and will probably break).

I don't like this.  Please standardize your product.  I want them all to be good like my first one, not like my broken one, and I don't want the new ones I just purchased to break.

2443,2443,B0006NDF8A,A16ALXKQ02SKYG,"I just bought a Stratocaster electric guitar and wanted a stand to put it away safely when Im not using it. I chose this one because it didn't cost the earth and was highly rated.

I was a little apprehensive about a few bad reviews regarding stability but I neednt have worried. My guitar weighs about 8lbs and has a regular smaller head. So when placed it on the rack it has a low center of gravity and is quite stable. Some guitars with a heavy head might not fare as well this may be the reason for at least some of the poor reviews.

The stand has a three point base and the rear leg is very short which was a concern for stability. But having tried it, I can see why they chose this design because it takes up less room and can stand up close to a wall.  My original intent was to leave it standing on the studio floor when Im not using the guitar but with three puppies running around (who are just tall enough to reach the guitar on its stand) I soon changed my plan. I now have it standing on the back corner of a desk about three feet up from the floor.  The stand is stable if you push directly backwards or sideways; a little less so at 45 degrees towards the back. But it seems very secure on my desk, looks really nice facing me and is in easy reach when Im working.

The cradle the guitar sits on is covered with foam and pivots so its very easy to quickly put the guitar down and seat the neck securely in the U shaped  holder on the vertical stem at the back. The steel stem is height adjustable to suit a range of instruments and there is a rubber  security strap that can be closed to prevent the guitar falling forwards. The strap is nice but not really necessary since gravity holds my guitar quite securely.

For the low price, this stand is exceptional value. It is sturdy enough for most people though if you have small kids and/or pets running around you might want to look for something like a hard case or wall mount or something with a more permanent base.

I can definitely see why this is such a popular stand. Im amazed how inexpensive it was and it does its job well.",3,2.52E-306,1,2.60E-306,1.53E-306,4.7,38.95,0.04991358,Neutral

2445,2445,B0006NDF8A,ACSJ5X37LIDWY,"For ten bucks a toss, who can quibble?  I wanted something that supported the neck, because I had a couple of mishaps with other designs.  These are adequately strong and stable.  Contrary to some other reviewers, I noticed no smell, I had no problems with the fittings or set screws, and had no significant instability problems.  The stubby rear leg is not an issue: the stand is not going to fall over backwards.  True, there is more possibility of falling forwards, but careful placement of the guitar body in the swiveling lower yoke will shift the weight and improve stability.  It might make a difference what instrument you're using.  Or, do what I plan to do and set these against a wall so nobody will hit them from the back.

My only real complaint is that the legs do not lock positively into the deployed position, but tend to pop out of position.  But when standing upright, the weight of the instrument plus the weight of the stand itself negates this issue.

There are plenty of instrument stands out there with more features and much better protection.  They also cost many times as much.  These three are now at church, holding two guitars and a bass.

Between $7 and $13, earns it 4 stars.
if it were under $7, it would have gotten 5 stars.

It's only 3 pieces, no screws or bolts to install, just one little knob to tighten it down once assembled. No assembly instructions but honestly, really no need for them. The ""yoke"" that the guitar sits on swings freely and this is by design.

It seems to do ok holding my heavier solid body bass, as the weight of the guitar itself lends to the stability of the stand. My lighter hollow body guitar I think might be subject to tipping or at least getting knocked around. If you're careful enough and especially, as others have mentioned, place the stand in a corner, you're probably ok. I suspect it's ok if you're locating it somewhere that is more or less permanent and semi- out of the way. I definitely would not trust it out on a gig, there's just too much potential for somebody knocking it over.

There isn't a lot of difference between this and the Ultra stands in terms of design, construction, or even weight.  Nevertheless, I can't recall ever having this much trouble with guitars tipping over.  Breathe on it, over it goes.  Look at it, guitar's in the floor.  A flatulent dog?  Guard your guitar!  The security strap keeps the neck from falling out of the cradle, so the guitar and stand kind of spill over as a unit.

I'm going to try popping the rubber caps off the legs and pouring some BBs in there for added weight.  I think it's just a question that this stand is a few ounces too light.  It's probably made of steel tubing one gauge lighter or something.

3134,3134,B0006NDF8A,A3RUQO10JKY9NT,"For the past several years I have had my guitar hero guitars all over the place in the living room. They have been leaning against the wall, shoved under the couch, hanging on top of the tv stand, etc. Finally I realized enough is enough and wanted to get a stand to store them prior to their ritual Friday night usage.

For this task, I decided to try the On Stage XCG4 Tubular Guitar Stand. Also, yes, I do have a fender guitar in my bedroom that also requires a stand and, before moving onto my baby, I first wanted a subject to test the stand on.

For starters, this stand is priced at a very reasonable rate which is very helpful in todays horrible economy. It did not take much energy to convince the wife to loan me the money to purchase this item.

The stand was very simple to extend and put together. The legs fold and so, when putting together, make sure you snap them into place or else the stand itself will not be stable. The top tube inserts into the bottom tube and a nut in the back is what holds it into place. Also, this will allow you to adjust the height on the top of the cradle for proper placement. The cradle of the stand itself swivels. This helps in making sure that your guitar properly settles into the cradle safely and securely. There is also a rubber security band on the top tube that holds the neck of the guitar. This is a nice feature to make sure your guitar does not fall out in case the stand is forced to lean forward such as being bumped or, if you carry the stand with guitar in place, it will stay put during transportation.

Overall, this is a wonderful purchase. It is a very affordable well built product. Recommended to hold your guitar, let it be the real deal or your collection of guitar hero guitars.",3,2.55E-306,1,2.51E-306,1.59E-306,4.7,38.95,0.174791667,Positive

The only complaint I have is that sometimes the guitar strap on my acoustic gets caught in the bottom foam-lined holder and rotates it around when I quickly remove the guitar from the stand. This can be fixed by not removing it so quickly or arranging the strap such that it doesn't catch on the bottom holder when you remove the guitar.

If the strap does get caught on the holder, it's likely to pull the whole thing out if it becomes fully rotated upside-down. This can be fixed by putting zip ties on the back of the holder where it meets the vertical tube so that it can't remove itself so easily.",3,0.097180801,0.629092367,0.094672555,0.057994579,4.7,38.95,0.175,Positive

Lots of them use cast iron for the bracket at the bottom which holds it all together, this one doesn't seem to.  The downside is it has a little less weight making it easier to tip with nothing on it.  The upside is strength as temp changes cause cast iron to eventually fracture (that's how my previous one broke).

The rubber strap to secure it is nice, but in my experience the rubber eventually tears after enough use.  I doubt this will last more than a few years of regular use, however that's a very minor gripe.

3257,3257,B0006NDF8A,A3KLG3J7L2RYJH,"First off, I have two of these stands, one Musicians Gear $5 stand, and a Guitar Center $13 stand of similar manufacture.  Let me start by saying that this is the only stand that I trust my more expensive guitars on.  The neck strap is far more secure than that on the musicians gear one, and the Guitar Center stand doesn't have a strap.  That said, since no Guitar I have is worth more than $250, I don't really care much.

Since the time they worked on the marketing for this add, they appear to have begun wrapping the bar connecting the yoke to the base of the stand.  Both the musicians gear and the Guitar Center Stand have a tube welded onto the base which is bare metal which the yoke fits into.

The stand is not quite as stable as the musicians gear stand, but more so than the guitar center stand, probably due to a slightly smaller foot print, which if you live alone in a small area, is probably a good thing.

Other than that I can't really say much more, it's a stand.

The strap tie at the neck is easy to place and remove but I would not trust it on stage, it's just not snug enough to secure a guitar if the stand or guitar is knocked.

The base holder or fork is a little weird and takes some getting used to. It angles up toward the tips, which slides the guitar body back into the stand and that's good for balance. It works ok, I'll probably bend the tip ends straight up to make sure the guitar body doesn't slide outwards since I'm using mostly electrics.

I quickly sacrificed another, inferior-brand stand and collected it's rubber tubing.  A small piece cut from that tubing fit over the bare rod and now the stand was perfect.  All of these that I own have now received the same modification.

1. The arms at the bottom of the stand which cradle the guitar from underneath swivel wildly and at the slightest touch.  Just the act of removing the guitar from the stand can cause the lower arms to swivel out of place so that when I return the guitar to the stand, the lower arms are often turned the wrong way and unless I carefully turn the lower arms back to the correct position before placing the guitar back on the stand, my guitar is likely to go crashing to the floor.
2. The velveteen rubber padding wants to constantly slide off the upper arms leaving the guitar neck exposed to bare metal.  The little plastic stoppers at the ends of the arms are supposed to prevent this from happening but when the padding starts to slide off, the stoppers offer little or no resistance and just pop out so I must constantly be pushing the padding back into position and pushing the stoppers back into the ends of the arms.  And of course, with the stoppers constantly popping out and rolling across the floor, eventually and inevitably you will lose them, but that's OK because they don't do any good anyway.",3,0.090217416,0.650160773,0.09157353,0.054287494,4.7,38.95,0.038360882,Neutral

Not only do I use it on all the contacts on my audio processors, I used in on a electrical outlet that was difficult to plug in to, by applying a small amount to a plug in and the inserting in the outlet a few times it's now been buttery smooth ever since and that was about 1 year ago. I also used it on all my video connections; I have a projection TV and DVD player, Wii... All that stuff; it's not the newest equipment and uses some single RCA component connectors for some of the video signals so I applied a little Deoxit gold and the video picture was noticeably improved and stayed improved (I used to have to wiggle the connector about once a week to clear the static).

I also have a sony LCD computer monitor that has a common failure small connector internally, I had to thump the corner of the monitor at least once a day when the picture would go out. I disassembled it and used some gold on the terminals and the picture stayed good for about a year (time for another application now).

3448,3448,B00FC4YO60,A2PICNZWHEINQC,"I read about this product on a Nikon DSLR camera blog site. The bloggers recommended it to clean the camera and lens contact connectors that convey signals between the two. Apparently, the contacts oxidize over time causing the signals to be blocked. The camera/lens functions can stop or become intermittent.

I sprayed the cleaner on Q-tips and applied it to the contacts. I could see from the discoloration of the Q-tips that it was removing oxidation from the contacts.

I now have it on my electronic calendar to use this DeoxIT cleaner annually on my cameras and lens.

One tip: Be sure you are far away from camera/lens when you spray this cleaner on the Q-tips. The stream that comes out is hard and fast. You don't want to get the cleaner on the outside or inside of the camera/lens or you will have a bigger cleaning job that you had when you started.",3,1,2.68E-307,4.10E-306,2.49E-306,4.8,19.99,0.115625,Positive
3449,3449,B00FC4YO60,A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q,"DeoxIT is manfuctured by Caig but is often sold under the name of one their distrubutors ""Hosa"". Whether the product you buy says ""Caig DeoxIT"" or ""Hosa DeoxIT"" - it is the same product. ""DeoxIT"" is a registered tradename and that is what you are looking for. Hopefully that information eliminates some initial confusion.

As an electrical engineer I've used DeoxIT for over 30 years. In fact - it is the only contact cleaner, lubricant, and contact enhancer I trust. From Boeing, Bose, General Electric, Hewlett Pack, etc, etc this product is the gold standard and widely used in manufacturing and within small professional circles.

Prior to the internet and companies like Amazon this product was unknown and largely unavailable.

Having said that ---- every consumer should know that ALL DeoxIT products are superior, ALL formulas are virtually guaranteed to do NO harm and even if you don't use the optimum formula of DeoxIT it will still, quite likely, improve a poor connection and/or protect a new one.

DeoxIT is sold in 4 broad categories.

D series - first and foremost a heavy duty contact cleaner with contact enhancer/protection - I'd say this is Caig/Hosa's most universal product

S series (aka Shield S series) - for outdoor environments. Particularily benefical in salt or other harsh outdoor environments. If the connections are not new - cleaning with a D series is required. I'd use this on a boat, an outdoor generator, etc

G Series (aka Gold series) - designed for gold and base metals. It offers minor cleaning properties. For gold contacts it offers near perfect protection and will enhance electrical connections for gold, etc. However its cleaning properties are minimal and since gold does not oxidize and usually offers a near perfect connection to begin with this product is largely unneeded. Yet, if you have highly sensitive circuit boards with gold plated connectors, operating at very low voltages, using gold plated connectors that might act up from time to time then this is your product. If you have other gold plated connections such as used in audio, etc this product is largely unneeded yet it will do no harm and may slightly enhance the connection over the very long term (years) as would the D series product.

F Series (aka Fader F series) - desiged for ""faders"" aka ""volume controls"" aka ""pots"" or potentiometers aka rotary controls. If that applies to what you are working on then this is the most appropriate cleaner/lubricant. It works on carbon based (extremely common) or conductive plastic controls which essentially encompasses the entire universe of rotary controls.

In the end, I hope this description helps you pick the best formula for your needs but the bottom line is the Caig/Hosa contact cleaners/enhancers are all first class and even if you pick a less than perfect formulation it will not only do NO harm but likely still fix your problem. The most universal product, as previously noted, is the D series spray cleaner/restorer.

nope, it doesn't fit the CR-249 Keepsake Turntable record player. i bought this turntable as a birthday gift for my girlfriend and stupidly did not purchase replacement needles along with it. a day after i gave it to her, i was cleaning and accidentally dropped the record player. the needle broke. after calling around to local music stores, i found that the only place i could purchase a replacement was Amazon. when i received the needles, they clearly looked different than the original one and it was soon clear that it did not fit on the arm of the record player. severely dissapointed is an understatement, as my girlfriend now has to wait another 2 weeks for the correct needles to arrive. by the way, the replacement needle for the CR-249 Keepsake is the NP4.

as far as the needle itself, it seemed to be a more deluxe version of the original and sturdier. the needle is a diamond stylus, so it is just a little tiny diamond-shaped pointy nub, as opposed to a long silver piece of metal. i wish it would have fit because it looked of higher quality than the NP4.",4,1,3.00E-307,3.70E-306,2.95E-306,4.4,12.75,0.109027778,Positive

This product does not operate as advertised or presumed.

Pro:
The sound quality is fantastic, with a wide range of acceptance and little stutter or background hum.

Cons:
Increasingly quiet ( and yes i mean increasingly) when first received it is was fairly quiet and was able to compensate with boosting the sensitivity PC side, but it has only gotten quieter over time to the point where it is almost worthless. Yes i have tried an external booster, to no avail, but an external amplifier shouldn't be necessary for a microphone such as this.

Look, the microphone looks nice but just isn't up to doing real use, the only time i could call this thing as passable quality is when i had it plugged into a $200 dollar amplifier just so i could record some thing without eating this piece of junk.

Update: 3/31/2018 - So far it still seems sturdy. I would say that the semi-squishy plastic pad that helps protect the desk might be stuck with one side squished flatter, mostly because I leave it attached to the desk. I haven't noticed any damage on the desk, so it seems fine. My current desk was a budget purchase and I plan on replacing it in the future. For those seriously worried about damage from any form of clamp, I suggest using a clear desk pad protector.

Except this one is name brand and the other is a generic ebay one.  Both are the same price, but I wanted the 2 day shipping rather than waiting 10 days.

This one is difficult to articulate and position.  It fights back at you any time you want to make minor adjustments with the microphone.  As I do streaming, podcasting and other game-related recordings, I use this one for guests.  Often, when we need minor adjustments from speaking to playing, the ""generic"" one I purchased on ebay is exactly as I'd expect.  It it counter weights the microphone perfectly, but enough so that it's easy to move and adjust.

I don't know how two arm stands, with the same design and same construction can be so very different.  I can't recommend this one if  you need something that can swivel out of the way when you're done, or for something that you need to reposition often.

The arm has a section that connects it to the clam (which has a hole for it). You insert the arm in there and then tighten a screw to hold the arm in place. The problem is that this part that is inserted in the clamp is a hollow sheet of metal, if you tighten the screw a lot you might bend it.

But the stand it self is the problem. Theres a little rubber piece where you tighten on to a surface. Mines is litterlay sliding off. And doesnt hold for to long before my mic ends up on the ground.

For reference, I bought this with a Blue Yeti, a Blue Radius II Microphone Shock Mount, and a Dragonpad USA Pop filter (Would NOT recommend getting this pop filter for any reason).
This mic stand is a pain in the ass to try and figure out what you're actually ALLOWED to do with it. You might think ""Oh maybe I could hang my mic upsides down"" or ""Put it at a such and such angle"". Nope! You're gonna have this baby set in one position and one position only, completely upright and as low to your desk as possible.
If you wanna attach a Pop Filter you'll have a fun time attaching it. If you attach it to the Shock Mount you risk it tipping over by just touching it accidentally and if you try and tighten it onto the lower end of the arm stand you squeeze the beams together and it just doesn't feel right. So I ended up stretching it out a good bit as I attached it to the back end of the arm stand.
This Mic stand is NOT flexible at all for the Blue Yeti w/ Shock Mount and should be used for very light weight microphones which do not need a shock mount.",4,1,1.83E-307,3.04E-306,1.59E-306,4.3,16.99,0.141675485,Positive

I have to be so careful moving the arm as it comes off the table incredibly easily. Luckily, my floor is carpeted, or my new Snowball mic and pop filter might have busted from falling so many times. No matter how tight it seems to be, as soon as I swivel the boom, it starts to move.

The arm is very stiff and I pinched my fingers a number of times (my error - keep your fingers OUT of the area between the two metal pieces as they open and close depending on where the boom is). But it does what it's supposed to do.

The swivel works great - but I have to swivel very, very carefully to ensure the table connector doesn't come off.

All in all, I'm hoping to learn to co-exist with this boom arm. It functions as described, but the part that attaches to the table is definitely defective.",4,0.766069849,0.003895709,0.06590715,0.036169338,4.3,16.99,0.07533189,Neutral

Mine is mounted in such a way that all I need to do is swing in into place and the mic (Bule Yeti) is just where it needs to be.  The Yeti is a heavy mic and the boom arm needs a good bit of tightening up at the joints to keep it in place, particularly at the end where the mounting bolt connects to your spider mount or directly to the mic itself.  The bolts and nuts are metric (7mm and 6mm, respectively) which is odd but, I've got one nut driver of each size so no issue there.  I would have preferred a larger size bolts/nuts, but they do the job.  There is a large plastic wing-nut tightener at the middle of the arm.  They should have put one or more of these at each of the other two locations.  Other reviewers have discussed the issue where the NEEWER says in their listing that this won't work with the Yeti ... it does if you put your thinking cap on and look at the mic connection point.

I love being able to rotate the mic in and out, up and down as needed.

The only downsides I find are:
1. I am a hand mover when I talk and any accidental bumps add a bit of spring/metal vibration to the audio. (I think it's my mic settings, it's so good!)
2. The whole arm and mic setup will fall down sideways if you don't secure the arm properly or if you try to secure it to the wrong surface.
3. The connector that actually holds the mic is a little wobbly and won't hold the mic sideways (it will rotate itself back upright). It's workable but means that you need to rely more on the adjustment of the arm itself.

A cheap mic stand made with high quality materials.

Pros:
-Cheap
-Mic arms support very good swiveling and a lot of angles
-High quality spring arms
- Can support low quality mic's out of the box

Cons:
-Had to purchase a separate adapter to be able to use this with my Microphone
-cheaply constructed desk mount (keeps randomly falling off of my desk)
-when it falls, quite often, it falls hard and has damaged my Microphone
-cheap screw that doesn't allow you to swivel it without it moving on the desk
Conclusion: There are lots of better options out there, and because of the fact that it keeps falling off of my desk I had to put it on the shelf, hoping I will have a use for it in the future. Be smart and understand that you get what you pay for and you might want to pay a little extra when it is an item that will be supporting an expensive piece of equipment like I did after purchasing this entry level scissor stand.",4,1,1.90E-307,2.96E-306,1.69E-306,4.3,16.99,0.156395503,Positive

5232,5233,B00DY1F2CS,A3H5PP1S9SYNVN,"I'm actually incredibly surprised how well this little cheap arm works with the Blue Yeti.  I've had mine mounted for a couple months now, and move it daily, nothing has worn out or flopped over, it just holds my mic and moves with little effort.  Wobbles a little bit, and where it connects to the base is a little lower quality, but heck it was only $13.50 when I got it.  For that price it's a steal of a deal.

One word of warning, the included adapter (which is screwed on to the bottom of the vocal-style mic holder) is plastic and will strip if you tighten it too much.  Makes sense since the Yeti and Neewer stand screw areas are both metal.  I imagine I'll have to replace that at some point, but not a big deal.

The mount that attaches to your desk has received an upgrade, allowing for a tighter fit on the boom arm stalk, and a more robust build of the mount overall. My previous mount had a D-shaped hole the boom arm stalk slipped into, which allowed for a lot of movement regardless of how tight you made the clamping screw. It was also equipped with an oversized plastic wingnut for securing the mount to the desk. The upgraded mount rectifies both those issues.
The stalk mount is now round, allowing for a near tight fit, without any wobble.

The Blue Yeti Pro mic is way to heavy. The boom does work with the Blue Yeti Pro with a few modifications. I also included the Blue Radius II shock mount and the Blue pop filter which adds even more weight. This modification takes a bit of minor engineering. You also need access to a welder, a drill and some wrenches. The swivel mount was re welded and completely modified to handle the weight of the heavy mic.

5348,5349,B00DY1F2CS,A64S8V75ITLFG,"I bought this thing to suspend what I suppose is a typical condenser microphone.  Mine happens to weigh 14oz - I got out a scale for this.  Let's review this piece by piece, starting from the bottom.

The mounting is acceptable...  With enough clamping pressure for a secure fit, there's some distortion in the screw part of the clamp, but whatever.  It works...  I use some cardboard between the screw plate and the upper part of the mount to keep them from direct contact with the clamped surface.

Basically, the boom is loose in the boom holder, and screwing it down changes the boom position from limp to erect.  It makes turning the boom annoying - either the screw is so tight the mount moves, or it's so loose the boom almost inevitably pops out.  Between just makes moving it difficult.  (see note 1).

The boom springs and function is good.  It goes up - it stays up.  It goes down - it stays down.  This part gets some praise for working right.  However, the enjoyment is severely limited by the issue above.

If your mic/shock mount and the male end don't match, there's a removable adapter in the dynamic mic holder.  It's where the stem connects to the holder, and can be removed with...a butter knife.  (see note 2)

Originally, the boom was unable to hold my microphone.  The stem would sag, etc.  Tightening the bolts didn't really help...  The fix is easy and is seen in my third and fourth pictures: remove the plastic knob and carriage bolt from the elbow part of the boom and swap with the hex bolt and nut from the stem mount.  Like this, you can tighten the mic stem joint properly!!!  Note that this takes a moderate amount of dexterity to reassemble the stem part unless some sort of leader is used when removing the stem screw to capture the assembly.  (see note 3)

Just putting on an M4 female screw head like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/uxcell-M4-Female-Thread-33mm-Plastic-Star-Head-Screw-On-Clamping-Knob-5pcs/dp/B019W9NN5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">uxcell M4 Female Thread 33mm Plastic Star Head Screw On Clamping Knob 5pcs</a>&nbsp;won't work so well because the elbow bolt is a carriage bolt, and the stem bolt is a plain hex bolt and unless you want to get out the sockets every time you adjust your mic, you would prefer a carriage bolt.

The downside is that you can't adjust the elbow tightness.  This does matter a bit because the boom will so easily slip out of the mount.  But consider that it's an annoyance that lasts only the length of the time the boom is being moved versus the time the mic is being held up from falling.

-End Review-

* note 1
The part that keeps the rest of the boom from turning (via a screw on the mount) kind of sucks.  In an ideal world, I suppose, the inner diameter of the mount would be just larger than the outer diameter of the boom end.  Basically, it would fit smoothly - just less than a tight fit - and the locking screw, which keeps the boom from turning on the mount, would barely need a turn to work.  However, because the ID/OD differences, it takes multiple turns of the screw which then forces the rest of the boom erect.

* note 2
Some people think a coin will work for this.  If it works for them that's good, but there's not much for a coin to grip on.  A butter knife is thin and strong enough, while being easy to obtain.

* note 3
The bolt diameter is 4mm by 20mm long.

This is from the original version of the review.  Pictures 1 and 2 are related to it.  I have since updated but keep the old text here:
<strike>
To get the boom to hold the mic in a position I want, I have to use thick copper wires from the shock mount to one of the hinge parts, and put some sort of object to pick up enough slack to lift up the microphone to the position I want.  Without it, it just sags down as much as gravity can have it.  I can't even have it sagged down and turn the mic, because then there's that 14oz on one side of the friction hold, and then it sags further.  I've tried tightening the joint, adding washers, using sandpaper, superglue, and I'm about to borrow a welder.

Since I didn't have any of the parts (such as a stand, power supply, shock mount, etc.) I was looking for a good budget introductory set. After searching for ~1 week I came across this kit which was considerably cheaper than the combined cost of similar setups if I had purchased the different parts individually.
I've been using this setup for about 2 months now and love it. If you're looking to get a microphone setup this is by far the best ""bang for your buck"" deal I found. I've listed out a few pros and cons for this setup but overall the positive aspects far outweigh the negative aspects.

Pros:
-Cheap bundle, no need to piecemeal parts
-Quality parts, especially the microphone unlike other bundles I viewed
-Looks pretty neat

Cons:
-The wire arm on the pop filter sucks and doesn't really hold well, I never planned on using it initially, however, so I didn't let this effect my overall rating.
-The scissor arm stand and clamp don't really have a locking mechanism besides just tightening a thumb screw",4,1,1.75E-307,1.85E-306,1.41E-306,4.3,16.99,0.124011858,Positive

The joints can be tightened up, but you have to have metric sockets or wrenches to tighten the nuts and bolts.  Products sold straight out of China without an American company doing the specs generally use metric nuts and bolts.

There are other versions of this boom arm that have hand tightened wing nuts attached at the joints.

It was one solid piece of plastic. I was still able to make it work though with a whole lot of black electrical tape to hold the snowball into the clamp.

5581,5583,B00DY1F2CS,A3U9HY7KBG7RTZ,"As the phrase goes, you get what you pay for. This mic stand isn't bad, but it isn't spectacular either. If you're looking for something that'll get you through an amateur AV setup, then this'll fit the bill fantastically. It boasts quite a bit of posability in its two spring-loaded joints, holding steady on almost any position you decide to put it in. However, the top joint is a bit loose and often leads to the weight of my microphone making it sink down. Can be remedied by tightening the screw and nut, but in my experience this is only a temporary fix as it just makes it fall down slower, loosening the bolt again as it does so. Also, the clip that attaches to your desk is made of weak metal, and in tightening mine to a point that it wouldn't wobble anymore, I actually bent it a bit. The screw on the side of the clip that is supposed to lock the stand from being able to pivot around after fastening does barely anything.

Now all these criticisms, but I still give it a four? Yeah. Like I said, you get what you pay for, but even for the flaws this stand has, none of them are dealbreakers in their current state. If, for example, the sagging connector was swinging freely, I wouldn't recommend it, but currently it doesn't do anything but hang down a few degrees more than I would maybe want it to.

It's a new hobby, so I didn't want to go all out and spend a ton of money on gear. I want to see if I stick with this hobby before I invest too deeply into it. This arm is super affordable and I like that it comes with a clamp so I can place it anywhere. It's smaller than I was expecting (mind you, I didn't actually pay much attention to the dimensions, and I'm just used to the gigantic arms that are in the studios at my office). It's the perfect size for my miniature home studio though, so no complaints in that regard. It's super easy to use, the mic clip has an adapter inside so that I could remove that clip and attach my condenser mic shock mount. It's basically ""plug and play"" if you will. You just unbox and attach two parts, and you're ready to go.

I did deduct one star because where the main arm attaches to the c-clamp, you have to tighten down the knob to keep it in place. Which is fine, I don't mind a bit of manual labor involved in adjusting my setup. But the annoyance is that once I've tightened down the knob, it still doesn't always hold the arm in place.

One problem!

5736,5739,B00DY1F2CS,A3AT3850OO5E9D,"This is not a professional microphone arm, but that's not a bad thing.

Truly professional microphone arms are going to be larger and stretch longer.  That said, this arm extends ~30"" which may be all you need.

Pro arms will have an easily adjustable tension at all points.  The newer arm can be adjusted if you have a heavy mic at a single point without tools.  It held my Monoprice 600800 just fine out of the box, though for heavy mics or if parts wear over time, a pair of small wrenches can keep everything tight.

Pro arms will have a better fitting contact and tightening system connecting the arm and clamp.  Nothing good to say here about the Neewer, they need a nylon bushing at the point the arm slides into the clamp and a rubber tipped tightening knob to adjust the force needed to turn the arm.  Keep the price in mind, I guess.

Pro arms will have a place to channel the mic cable in the arm.  With the Neewer, you need to get creative with your zipties.

Pro arms will be near silent throughout their lifespan.  The Neewer was surprisingly quiet out of the box.  We'll see how this lasts over time.

Pro arm will cost 10x what the Neewer did.  Most people probably need the money more than they need a pro arm.

At the end of the day, the value of this product is great, it does what you need it to do, and there are very few design shortcomings.  For a project studio, I wouldn't hesitate outfit a few of these.

+2 Stars: Price is a fraction of pro models, and half or other ""cheap"" models.
+1 Star: Quiet out of the box
+1 Star: Sturdy enough for large mics and can be adjusted at all pivot points with some work.
+1 Star: Color options.  Black goes with everything, but Red, White, and Blue are cool too.

Neutral: Size.  Some people may prefer the more compact size with less reach.

-1 Star for not even trying to make the connection between the arm and clamp useful.  Wobbly and the non-padded tightening screw just scratches everything up if you want to spin the arm.",4,0.611047088,0.003223924,0.050928902,0.02905104,4.3,16.99,0.138629344,Positive

It is a little shorter than i'd like but that isn't the issue. the issue is I needed to go through and tighten the bolts in areas because it barely supported my Mic (blue yeti) now I know the yet is a heavier mic than most so I'll let it slide.

I also had to loosen bolts on the boom because I couldn't even move it once it was mounted to my desk.

NOTE: DO NOT ATTACH TO AN EXPENSIVE DESK!

 I have a transition desk that goes from standing to sitting and it is expensive. I figured with the boom having some pading on the clamp that allows mounting to the desk would be enough. Well when I went to swing the mic around for use it scratched the living hell out of my desk and it also left a light imprint on my desk. I since put cardboard under it to protectiong. I don't give a s*** if it scratched the bottom of the desk... so in the end... Ill say its worth the buy i think.... but if you can afford a more expensive boom i'd say get it.

5800,5803,B00DY1F2CS,A3V5LHMLUPB48P,"In general, it does what it needs to do;  however, 2 improvements for the manufacturer/designer consider.

1) There should be a degree of freedom given where the pin of the arm is placed into the clamping base.  One has to lock it by tightening the finger bolt.  By doing this, it does not allow the user to pivot the stand and microphone without having to unscrew the bolt (unless it idea is to strip the bolt over time, which never ended well for me.)

2) At the end of the arm where the bolt and nut holding the microphone and the arm meet, there should be a finger tightening bolt; otherwise, the weight of the microphone pulls it down.  This can remedied by a racket set.

This is an inexpensive stand, but has major flaws IMHO. I m used to these types of stands as I have used much more expensive ones for lights when I draft (I am in the architecture profession). There are a few problems with this stand but if you are careful you can make it work for a bit.

1) the stand sits in the clamp and you can tighten it with a screw. Overtighten a bit, and the metal bends. Even with all parts of the stand loose, its very easy to pull on the stand and bend the thin metal sleeve that slides into the bracket. The bracket itself is very sturdy and has nice padding to limit any markings on your desk, etc.

2) The plastic collar that allows mics to screw into the stand if you want to use a shock mount and not the included attachment is plastic and strips rather easily. Secure the mic on the stand but don't over tighten and it should last a bit.

3) The white plastic adapter to hook the microphone into a power supply is not well made and is like a cheap garage door opener that wants to always pop apart. I recommend taking some electrical tape to prevent this from happening.

My suggestion is having an adult set the microphone to a set position, and leaving it there. It does not have a very long reach which is good and bad. I recommend leaving it loose in the base and allow the person using it to swing it out of the way instead of back and forth and it should last longer.

To be fair, it is not that expensive, but it should also withstand some use. It is a horribly designed product and I would avoid it at all costs.",4,0.196162332,0.236744033,0.201030778,0.116441543,4.3,16.99,0.000258784,Neutral

This one has a full length screw - meaning it will actually touch the other side of the bracket when it's closed.

1.) I'm not able to tighten the angular grip where it holds my mic.

2.) When the boom is tighten near the middle of my desk, anything I drop or tap slightly will cause the shocks on the boom to make a small shaky noise. I've fixed this issue by moving the boom to the left side of my desk.

Now this is a great boom, don't get me wrong. Especially for the price you're paying for it. I just don't know how to get around these issues if it weren't for my desk absorbing the shock sound.

To start, if you have a table that isn't flat underneath and instead has a bit of a lip don't even bother. I have a cheap folding 72inch folding table from Walmart for my setup. Kinda eh, but unless i'm paying $300 for a slab of whatever material it is and some poles or buying materials from Home Depot and making my own, this is pretty much all of my choices.

So i've been using a block of wood under the table to help give a bit of space to clamp onto, and while that's helped here or there it would still fall off randomly. And i've also found that over time pressure from making sure it's tight enough to stay clamped has pushed the tightening screw through the extremely crappy metal cup they use to try to keep it clamped on.

The manner in which it levers itself on your desk is also exceptional; it virtually works with any sort of desk-- even the cheapest, oldest thing you might have laying around.

I am no immediate expert with it, but it took me a moments time to realize just how I had to fasten it appropriately. I am surprised to learn that it even worked with my aftermarket BM-800 condenser microphone, despite coming with no tools to fasten it.

Once done, it has done a great job holding up. My only complaint is how my microphone seems to heavy to keep it held in an upright position, which surprises me.

5908,5911,B00DY1F2CS,A6LK6A7SDN86F,"I love this stand.  I have used it for about four months, and have had no issues (besides the one I am about to describe) with build quality, length, or anything else.  It is useful for holding a microphone in the studio when I am too lazy to pull out the real boom stand and when I am recording close to my desk anyway.  It functions and holds both a condenser in a shock mount and a dynamic mic very well.

However, I have one major complaint about the design.  The part that screws on to the mic clip is able to rotate if you keep turning it.  But you can only rotate it clockwise to avoid unscrewing the clip.  There is also no screw-able washer that goes on the adapter that the clip is on to keep the clip in place when you have screwed as far as you want to go, so you have to screw all the way in until the adapter is too deep inside the clip to be able to unscrew just the clip to remove it.  As a result, you have to unscrew the clip, then use a tool to go in and unscrew the adapter before you put it back on the stand.

Put together, these two problems make for a frustrating fidget if you accidentally rotate your microphone a little too far.
My solution is to hot/super glue the part that rotates, and to add a screw washer from an old mic stand so that there are no more rotation problems to deal with.

First off it is TINY, it is not nearly long enough to reach OVER a monitor or even around one for that matter. I've spent probably an hour trying to set it up and it just will not work. I finally found a basic pretty junk spot to put it but it works right so who gives I'm already pissed off at this product for not fitting on anything of mine right? well too bad either the 2nd arm the one that holds the microphone falls back down or the terribly non secure mount gives out and falls off my desk. I've tried to mounting it EVERYWHERE possible. On my desk, on my monitor riser, on my bed frame next to my desk, on the pole of my bedframe since my room is tiny so I needed my desk to be under my bed in a loft fashion. literally nowhere fits and I cant seem to get it to work AT ALL. I right now have no way of using my microphone and havn't for months I have no clue what to do since I don't have the money for a nice microphone arm. I also cannot return this item since I ended up having to break part of it to try a new way of mounting it.

5936,5940,B00DY1F2CS,AIWMK8FNOSXMR,"This was my first microphone ""stand"" that I bought back in September 2015. I bought it because of good budget price and the room configuration I had at the time. I've used a couple different microphones with this, of varying weights. The included mic clamp didn't fit any of the microphones i used, we used their included shock-mounts.
- The CAD U37 USB condenser mic and AKG Pro Audio C214 condenser mic didn't weigh the swivel head down.
- The Behringer B-1 condenser mic did make swivel head droop down.
- The arm is kinda smaller than I thought, but coincidentally worked perfect for where we were using it.
- The base clamp is very strong and can hold the arm securely in place.
- The knob handles to tighten the base clamp are plastic. The rest of the contraption is steel.
- There are springs on it. If you do a clap test, you'll find they do make noise. We simply wrapped them with foam similar to bed mattress foam to remove that noise.

I gave it 5 stars because it did everything I wanted it to do. The little things like the springs making noise is an easy fix, and isn't a fault in the manufacturing. If you got a sturdy desk, bookshelf, etc, or you got a tight space, this does work great. Great bang for your buck.",4,1,1.83E-307,2.76E-306,1.60E-306,4.3,16.99,0.153474206,Positive

Here are the problems:
1. It is pretty small, there is not much reach on it but if you don't have a big desk its fine.
2. It has no real swivelling mechanism. It literally just sits loose in the slot that you use to connect the arm to the base. So you have to loosen the screw to make it swivel, and in doing this you risk the weight of it pulling the whole thing out of the slot and falling over. Especially when adjusting the arm higher up, it can pull the arm out of the slot.

However when you want to adjust it or lift it so its higher its very loose. Hard to describe it in words but where it mounts is loose, not the clamp but the small tube that goes into the clamp's hole is where its loose. I tried to modify it with tape and other things but nothing helped. On top of that the metal used there is VERY slim and was actually being quickly cut off just from normal rotation. I have positioned it where i like it and haven't moved it much, I don't expect it to last long because lets face it, It's very cheap and gets the job done, transfers hardly any vibrations to the mic. I use an Audio-Technica AT 2035 with their standard shock mount. I'm satisfied with the product but it could definitely be better. For the price you won't beat it. I'm neutral on the purchase but If you are serious about recording I'd suggest going in at a higher price point. This product is for people just starting out, maybe not serious about recording or low budget productions. I expect to need a new one in less than a year.

CONS: Cheap metal / Poor design / Can't rotate or move at all / Does a poor job in description alerting the buyer that they'll likely need an adapter. (You need a 3/8'' to 5/8'' mic adapter to convert it to a standard attachment. The wording ""1.26""/32mm"" is bizarre.) / Loud coils that could damage audio quality if bumped, even slightly.

VERDICT: Go buy a desktop stand with range to move, such as a kick-drum mic stand. It'll be far sturdier and generate less metal shavings all across your desk.",4,0.00396381,8.41E-05,0.001088608,0.000731704,4.3,16.99,-0.025490196,Neutral

6096,6101,B00DY1F2CS,A35O0E66TJG8E,"I got this to fit an ATR2100 and it meets my needs but I'm a little disappointed by it's quality.

The bad - I was a little bit surprised by the size of it, it's a lot smaller than it looks in the pictures. The part that clamps to the desk tends to wobble when I move it and it's a bit annoying. The neck that you insert your mic into turns to the left and the right, but when ""trying"" to turn it to the left, it often tries to unscrew itself which shouldn't be happening. If the mic is in an upright position rather than hanging, it will slowly fall on it's own, the mic im using is fairly light as well, so it's the arm that I'm unsatisfied with.

The Good - It holds position pretty well and takes just the right amount of force to move up, down, in and out. There isn't a position that I can't get, it works great. My microphone came with a neck or a holster and it screwed right onto the arm without any problems and the desk clamp is nice and sturdy.",4,0.739299227,0.003633041,0.058453766,0.032898876,4.3,16.99,0.069390332,Neutral

So, I tried that and took a bunch of pictures.  It seems like it might not be THE most steady thing, but it's not wobbling or moving around in unexpected ways, so I'm ok without an adapter for now.  I would be careful while screwing this piece onto the bottom of the Yeti so that you're not creating unnecessary friction, as it does seem to fray away a bit of the plastic.  ^_^  Looking forward to using the setup for several things.

Everything was easy to assemble and the mount fits perfectly on my microphone. Inside the mount there is a small piece to un-screw and use on your Blu SnowBall!!

Yes Sort of, its not the main arm that's the problem its the rod at the end which attaches to it, there is no way to tighten it down to keep it from drooping so you either have to have it point up or down as you can see in my pictures. Another problem i have with this arm is its desk camp mount it doesn't swivel or turn very smooth. Also while there is a slim rubber pad on the underside of the desk clamp, the metal screw to secure it to the desk has no protection at all. (I added one of thoughts tiny chair leg pads to mine  and it works). Other than that this Arm is great for the price. Just be aware you might have to do some fiddling if your going to use a heavy mic and a Shock mount attached as well.

Pros: very well made metal construction, cool cable management cut outs,

Cons: no way to tighten a bolt at the connector end of the arm so it doesn't  droop, No protective padding on the actual screw for the bottom of the clamp and the swivel of the arm needs to be smoothed out.",4,1,2.02E-307,3.35E-306,1.86E-306,4.3,16.99,0.114738562,Positive

I'm not able to use it with my mic plus after I adjust the arm with the stand it moved losely one side to another. Lack of quality in this product that's why it is $13.50.

Updated review.

Muy recording needs does not state I have to move my mic from side to side very often but as I said before you can't use this suspension scissor stand right out of the box. Initially I gave this product 1 star since it does not come with a mic shock mount thread adapter. I had to go to local music audio and electronic stuff store to get this one. It cost me only US$ 1.10, I mean... Why didn't Neewer included this thread adapter along with scissor arm stand? It could save me some time and may have improved my post-purchase experience. Now product has 2 stars since previous defects reported can't be corrected by user.",4,0.751035692,0.003339664,0.053740545,0.030013716,4.3,16.99,-0.014556277,Neutral

Device specific.

Neewer mic stand.
This is an all around great stand. It's sturdy. The joints and Springs work well. It keeps the snowball mic in place. I do wish that there was another horizontal Swivel joint at the mic end of the arm. But for the price, it's pretty damn amazing.

CONS:
A little flimsy for heavier, condenser mics
Smaller diameter attachment than most stage microphones. Sm57 clip would need an adapter.

Here is the scoop:  The plastic end piece can be removed and you will find plastic threads that will fit your Blue Yeti Mic - until the Mics metal threads eats those wussy plastic threads for breakfast.  And then you will be where I found myself - wondering how to make this mic stand work.

What you will need to buy is this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Stage-MA300-5-8-Inch-Male-to-3-8-Inch-Female-Knurled-2-Piece-Mic-Adapter/dp/B001H5KP0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Stage MA300 5/8-Inch Male to 3/8-Inch Female Knurled 2 Piece Mic Adapter</a>.  This will allow you to connect the metal end of your mic stand to the metal threads of the Blue Yeti Mic.

6342,6347,B00DY1F2CS,A1VLP0I6IFDW5X,"I saw this microphone boom offered as part of a package with the Audio Technica AT2020 USB microphone. As I own one of the mikes, I thought it would be a good addition to my office. The boom arrived and was exactly as described on Amazon and took only minutes to set up. I have glass top desk, so I bought mounting pads and a plastic plate to protect the bottom of the glass. The top of the mounting is already padded with a spongy material that protects the top of the glass.

At first I as a bit confused as to how all the pieces fit together. If you look at the image of the boom, you see it comes with a plastic grip for a standard size microphone. The AT2020 is a bit larger so it won't fit in the supplied grip. What makes this fit together nicely is that the threaded bar holding the plastic grip has the same thread as the mounting that attaches to the mini tripod that came with the microphone.

The steps I followed are as follows:

Remove the AT2020 from the mini tripod microphone mount (supplied with the AT2020.)
Unscrew the plastic grip from the boom.
Unscrew the microphone mount from the mini tripod (supplied with the AT2020.)
Screw the microphone mount (from the tripod) onto the threaded bar on the boom. The threads should match.
Attach the AT2020 to the microphone mount now attached to the boom.
Adjust the microphone and tighten the microphone holder.

Pros

1) The boom attaches easily to the desk surface.
2) The boom is sturdy and holds the weight of the microphone.
3) The mounting pieces fit nicely together.
4) The boom is high enough to hole the AT2020 away from the field of vision of my webcam.
5) Once mounted, the microphone works nicely.

Cons

1) The boom is attached to the desk mount with a thumb screw. This loosens if you move the boom around too often.
2) the threaded mounting bar is designed to pivot in place. This makes it hard to attach the microphone mount tightly This is not a drawback unless you want to pivot the microphone, it will unloosen from the boom mounting bar.
3) The boom is a bit flimsy (but more solid than I expected for $12.)
4) There aren't good mountings or the microphone cable. I used black tie wraps to attach the cable to the boom. This suffices but is not optimal.

All in all, I get much more utility than the price I paid. I am happy with the results and would recommend this boom to anyone using the AT2020 for teleconferencing or online chat. I imagine that a suspension mount would isolate the microphone from the boom for a recording quality setup.",4,0.747350312,0.002921151,0.046180394,0.026084263,4.3,16.99,0.279239631,Positive

This is my first stand, and I am blown away by how perfect it is. It is very compact, sturdy, and reliable. At first, I did not understand how the snowball fit in the stand. I did not look at the videos nor read the instructions. I simply attached the stand to the microphone and jammed it into the microphone clip. I actually came here to give it 3 stars because it was wobbly, looked bad, and kept toppling over. I am so glad I skipped the embarrassment (up until I told all of you this) and saw a youtube video of how to properly install the microphone. I was surprised that the parts I needed were in the stand itself--I didn't need to improvise in the slightest. It now is absolutely perfect in every way. The microphone is exactly as I want it.

There was no possible way I could make the mic fit the mic hold slot, I even tried to use the CAD mic Shock Mount, but the screw grooves would not fit the grooves on the NEEWER Scissor arm. What I had to do is slide the shock mount down into the microphone clip, and use electrical tape to hold the mic.

It was my fault for not reading the instructions though the description clearly states a ""Microphone Clip Diameter is 1.26""/32mm"".
I Didn't calculate it right while i was ordering the mic at the same time as I was the NEEWER Scissor arm.

Other than that...

Pros:
-Great Structure, flexible to latch on to practicly any desk area.
-Great sleek metal finish to make the scissor arm look professional.
-Very easy to install.
-4 adjustable areas that allow you to adjust the location of the scissor arm at any time needed. (base, mid, top, and mic clip)
-Very good for its price.

Cons:
-Some mics won't fit the mic clip.

3/5 Stars because my mic wouldn't fit it. (personal situation)

I have no issues with the stand itself but attaching the Yeti isn't the optimal solution. Some users report not having the screw that fits into the Yeti but mine did, HOWEVER, it's plastic. Threading the piece into my yeti caused it to cross thread and now it's more of a plug and it certainly can't support the weight of the mic. Furthermore the standard thread on the arm is longer than the plastic screw cap which pushes into the Yeti never letting me fully tighten it down (this may have lead to the cross threading).

Anyway it looks like it works for some and might if you're really careful putting it into the bottom of the mic. I wouldn't move it afterwards if you succeed.

I paid for next day shipping and will update this post hopefully this evening!

UPDATE: Yeti goes on wonderfully w/ the new RAIDUS II, however, it's just so heavy I cannot get the stand to keep the mic level.

Also, the little metal bar where the mic actually attaches may require a threaded adapter, but more importantly it spins and that makes it a little tricky to tighten the mic onto it. You'll probably need a pair of pliers; I scratched mine up a little when I clamped down on it, but that's purely cosmetic. On the issue of an adapter: there's one included, located inside the mic clip, but it's made of plastic and you could accidentally strip it pretty easily. I recommend getting a metal adapter since the little pole on the arm is made of metal and your mic mount likely is, too.

If you have a lighter mic like the Blue Snowball or Yeti this will do the trick. The mounting bracket is separate from the arm in the box, just loosen the clamp screw  attach to your mounting surface (I chose a glass topped desk) tighten, insert the arm and tighten the arm screw and your good to go. Assembly and attachment took all of five minutes. I tried on a couple different thicknesses of desk to check the stability of the mounting clamp and all seems fine. As a budget item this arm is fine, sure it won't stand up to the $1,000 super quiet broadcast arms... but then this things under $20. For someone doing a podcast or someone who wants to get that mic stand off their desk this is perfect.

I tried three different Microphones in the arm, and as expected it could not handle the weight of the larger mics. The Blue Snowball and the Blue Yeti work just fine. but the Blue Bluebird was too heavy with the shock mount cage and all. I am not one bit surprised by this, and as I said as a budget arm this does the job well. The only ding I would give the arm is that there is no way to easily tighten the part where the mic screws to the arm. There are quick release screws on the base and on the middle of the arm, so you can't completely tighten it down rock steady if you need to.

Is there a separate part? Yes. Did it come in a separate package/plastic bag? No. Not at all. For me, it was literally attached to the mic stand itself, and just a simple hand unscrew, and boom, popped it on my Yeti and it worked just fine. Can it possibly be different for you? Yes.

This is more of a ""Try at your own risk if you have a Yeti. But still cheap at the same time."" While it wasn't in a separate bag, it was still with the Mic Stand itself. Which is better than not finding it at all.

Now onto the stand itself. It IS Rather short, so please be prepared if you have a large desk and want it to reach across. I had to put it on the side instead. But it DOES work well with the Yeti, and a simple Dragonpad Pop Filter on the stand itself. (Although look a bit odd)
Either way, it does its job. The metal itself is okay, but it's nothing to write home about. Just does it job, but can hear audible creaks/noises when it bends or goes in a certain way. Not break-worthy. But still get what you pay for.

Overall, I got the Mic Stand, and the Plastic Yeti fitter...thing... McGee. That's all I really asked for. It does its job.

Make no mistake, this arm is flimsy and ugly.  This company really followed the ""you get what you paid for"" moniker but this was exactly what I needed.  I am a professional videographer/filmmaker who needs to record voice overs for commercials and product videos and I wanted a way to suspend my Blue Yeti to avoid vibration from the table when recording.

The desk clamp on this thing sucks!  You must have flat thin edges on your table or mounting destination in order for it to clamp.  The desk in my office is ironically a rounded wood curve which for the life of me would not allow this dinky clamp to hold.  I eventually solved it by clamping the arm through a wire hole in the desk.  After it clamped, the suspension boom arm works decently.  Suspending the Yeti has removed the vibration from the table so it did it's job.  The arm is rather short in length but if you can work around the setup, try this out as it is extremely cheap in price.

The construction is metal with springs, similar to another mic arm we reviewed from the brand Tonor. It doesn't feel too cheap. The construction feels durable and should last for a while. This product is very easy to fold and disarm to can transport it or store it and it's lightweight too. This product lets you control the angle and rotation of the mic. The movement is kinda hard instead of fluid, but once you put the mic in a position it doesn't slip. Theres also knobs to secure it in place. The clamp that helps to secure the arm to the desk works well. It's better on a wood or solid desk, not something fragile like glass.

What I did not like was that the plastic piece that should hold the microphone isn't very good. The microphone can slide around and it's not a tight grip. I didn't have the same problem with the Tonor brand. You can remove it and attach something else if it fails. This one is cheaper than the Tonor brand (as of today) and other than the plastic they are the same.

The stand although feeling nice and rigid had to go because I need it to move out of the way sometimes, when back in when needed. Soon I came upon this cheap microphone stand which had a lot of great reviews so I decided to try it out myself. The stand came half assembled and was quite easy to setup. It was kind of flimsy which I obviously didn't like, and is quite weak to hold up my blue yeti, unless I angle the mic a certain way so it won't drop low again. The contraption that is suppose to hold the mic was too small for my blue yeti, and so I was left with only the plastic screw to hold my mic. NOT A GOOD IDEA NEEWER; This company should of made a contraption for all sizes, cause just this one screw was not enough whatsoever. It left my mic spinning loosely, so I tried to tighten it, shredding the plastic and making it even more loose, to the point where I had to ditch the position as seen in the advertisement, and go with the position I have seen in the picture. I also disliked how there was no cable routing available which is very necessary for long cables. This was soon solved however when I had a short cable which didn't really need managing.

HOW TO ATTACH A BLUE YETI MICROPHONE:
Despite the manufacture's assertion that it is not suitable  for the Blue Yeti microphone, I and many other reviewers found it to work great.  IF you want to use this with Blue Yeti, you just need to unscrew the plastic mount converter from the bottom of the black microphone holder included with this product (a butter knife works great for this, since it has a wide lateral slot across the bottom of the plastic mount converter).  Then simple screw the black mount converter into the bottom of the Blue Yeti, now the Blue Yeti can screw right onto the silver mic mount on the end of the stand (see attached pictures).  The fit with the plastic converter is very secure -- although it's made of plastic, the converter ends up being sandwiched between two sets of metal spiral grooves -- I haven't seen any slippage or loosening, even when positioning the mic upside down for extended periods of time.",4,1,1.74E-307,2.62E-306,1.52E-306,4.3,16.99,0.175310245,Positive

It mounts pretty solidly to the desk edge, etc. and stays in place well. The arms move relatively well considering this isn't something you'll want to be moving around a lot. Definitely no swinging the mic around like you see on tv. But for a desk mic you can easily move out of the way, it works really well. Depending on the mic you use. It comes with a decent cheap mic clip attached, that most standard dynamic type mics will fit in, with a plastic mic adapter. When I tried with my sm57-wannabe mic it held up fine without moving or dropping from the weight. I was impressed so far. So then I decided to try a big condenser mic with a shockmount. The shockmount screwed on nicely. Then I put the mic in. Droooooooop. Perhaps if mounted on a sturdier desk it wouldn't be an issue, but while it has no problems with the 8oz dynamic mic the almost 1lb condenser mic instantly caused it droop and lean.

That said, the ""mouth"" of this arm is quite accommodating, allowing you to grip desks up to about 2 inches (I haven't taken the time to exactly measure, though).

Overall, a great product for any level of voice user, from the semi-casual gamer to the at-home audio producer.",4,1,1.68E-307,2.72E-306,1.44E-306,4.3,16.99,0.159559885,Positive

The post on the arm screws straight into the mount on the Snowball with no need for additional attachments or clips. The mounting clamp on the base can attach to the edge of a desk up to six inches thick; so if you have a lip on your desk, it'll attach.

Not apparent from the product pictures is the fact that the base can swivel, so I can use the mic at my desk or swivel it around and record someone standing next to my desk, without having to move the arm at all. That was a neat little bonus I wasn't expecting.

Assembly is three steps and dead simple. The arm is sturdy and holds my mic in the position I place it without issue. It simply works and I have no complaints.

Some reviews complain the arm is short. The product description puts the arm at about 3ft and that's accurate enough. I'd say you should measure your surface and make sure the mounting point is less than 30"" from where you want the mic to be and it'll be fine.

For the price, this product is perfect. It helped me achieve the desired set-up I was looking for while also keeping my microphone exactly where I want it.

Now that my microphone is suspended, I have more desk space and I can position the microphone correctly to record better audio. I use to use the included stand for my snowball, but that meant it would easily pick up my keyboard and mouse clicks as it was directly near them.

6734,6740,B00DY1F2CS,A3BYCPRCB2GT01,"First off I jumped into buying this after reading alot of reviews about how it WOULD NOT work with the Blue Yeti and how people were saying the part that you need DOES NOT come with this mic arm. Well im here to disprove that. Mine did, however it did take me a short while to figure out where it was. Its actually pictured, and ive included my own doctored photo to show you where.

Overall the Mic arm is exactly as described. It handles the Blue Yeti alright, but i have cranked most of the dials so that it stays in place while the Mic is attached. I DO NOT leave the microphone attached when its not in use as it visibly causes the whole thing to sag once attached and I have to adjust the screws both on the middle of the arm and at the bottom to insure it won't move or sway if bumped even slightly.

The arm itself is actually surprisingly strong and well built for the price, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for one on a budget. It is however very short and if your looking to keep it out of the way you will need a larger desk space to accomodate this feat. As with my setup i find that I'am constantly moving it to an extended position to keep it out of the way of relaxed (netflix, etc) viewing of my monitors. If you can afford a better one then obviously you SHOULD go with a better one that is better fit to a Blue Yeti.",4,1,1.81E-307,2.77E-306,1.62E-306,4.3,16.99,0.17942029,Positive

The old stand I had forced me to lean forward to speak into my microphone, so it was a pain on my back. I talk to friends on TeamSpeak nearly everyday, so I decided it was time for a change. I own a Blue Snowball, and installation was easy. The microphone clip that comes with the stand has a little plastic piece that can be unscrewed with a quarter, which screws into the Snowball and onto the stand directly. My desk is small, so the stand was a perfect size. I mounted it near the back of the desk, and adjusted the reach so I could talk into my mic more easily. I love how easy it is to move and adjust, the only complaint I have really is that it was hard for me to find a good spot to attach my pop filter. More of an annoyance than a complaint, though.

6827,6833,B00DY1F2CS,A2KBJOADTFFWNO,"I purchased this boom arm along with the recommended Dragonpad studio pop filter. Setup was a breeze with the included desk clamp. The build is solid and sturdy without being clunky or unwieldy, the clamp is perfect for my desk, and my microphone cable's own Velcro loops make it easy to tie the cable down to the arm and keep it neat and tidy.

The arm is able to hold the weight of my rather large USB microphone, a Samson C01U, without any sort of budging or drooping. This was a little bit of a pleasant surprise, seeing as my roommate's large stage-style boom microphone stand could not hold up that microphone, and would cause it to slowly lower itself over time. Even when I'd try to tighten the boom joint screw as tightly as possible to prevent it from falling, it'd still slowly droop down. With the Neewer, I can even leave the elbow joint screw completely loose and it still won't move an inch.

I only have two complaints about this boom arm, the lesser of which was an oversight on my own part. I didn't think to check the specs (despite there being a picture showing that each segment of the arm was 35 cm) and figure out just what size the arm would be when it arrived. This resulted in the boom feeling a little bit smaller than I expected when I received it. I've since grown accustomed to the size and have managed to put the arm to good use regardless of my mistake.

My only legitimate complaint about the Neewer is the 3/8ths inch square rods used to construct the arm, in regards to the Dragonpad pop filter that's recommended to be purchased with it. The pop filter's clamp (on my unit, at least) is too large or loose to fit onto the skinny square rods that make up the boom arm. I'm not sure if I'm just stupid, but I can't get it to tighten properly to the arm on its own. I was able to remedy this by using a piece of cardboard from the packaging to wrap around the rod and create extra padding to give the pop filter something to grip. I'm not sure if other users who have purchased both products have had the same problem, but it seems like something that shouldn't really happen to two products that are suggested to be ordered together. So my only honest complaint, however slight, is not even about the arm or even the pop filter, but Amazon's recommendation.

With all that said, I have no reason to give the Neewer microphone boom scissor arm anything less than five stars. It does its job, and it does it beautifully. While I don't plan to move it anytime soon, it's nice and compact when it's folded up, for easy transportation. I can't praise the construction enough, and it just looks nice and stylish with the microphone and pop filter attached (despite my cardboard lifehack), mounted on my desk. I might see about adding some photos once I've got the rest of my computer assembly collected and arranged on the desk.",4,0.63662918,0.004087553,0.063322942,0.037000112,4.3,16.99,0.137891331,Positive

Pros: Strong build quality, no weigh issues or ""shakey"" feelings. Sturdy clamp makes location easy, saved a lot of room on my desk. Truly an amazing product for this price range, I will be using this for more than a year unless I see an imminent need for another stand.

Cons: Rotating the arm to swivel it away from you requires loosening of the portion holding the clamp to the arm apparatus, but that isn't really a big deal if you're keeping your mic in the same relative position most of the time.

Overall: Extremely satisfied with the build quality and use of this product, especially in this price range. If I were to increase price, I would likely choose another clam mic stand that has the ability to swivel built in and an extra adjuster on the end of the stand (to have greater control over microphone positioning).",4,0.683880253,0.002638465,0.041078672,0.023455018,4.3,16.99,0.227777778,Positive

As for the Blue Yeti! This is for those that think it doesn't work, what you have to do is that the end of the shock mount which screws into the arm normally can actually be unscrewed. It doesn't seem like it does, but after I looked at a youtube video where the guy did it with ease, I took a flathead screwdriver and put a little effort into it, and sure enough it unscrewed. You can then screw that end into the blue yeti which will then easily attach to the arm.

6923,6929,B00DY1F2CS,A3332KLFEJEADA,"I really wanted to get my USB mic off my desk while recording interviews for my podcast. Any noise I make against the desk (typing on the keyboard or just lightly thumping my hands against the surface of the desk as I gesticulate while speaking) gets picked up not only by the microphone but is also transmitted through the desk and mic stand as additional vibration. It's annoying and nearly impossible to prevent with a desktop mic.

Enter the NEEWER mic stand (I hoped), #1 best seller in mic stands on Amazon. The good reviews and reassurances that it could hold a decent amount up overrode my suspicion of its bargain basement price, so I bought it and set it up.

I don't return many products, but it was clear within the first few minutes of working with this mic stand that it was destined to go back to Amazon. While not difficult to assemble, the pieces are of mediocre quality at best and just fiddly to assemble and secure in place. That's not what you want when something is supposed to hold $100+ microphones suspended in the air above other expensive equipment.

Once the stand was secure, I set about trying to attach my mics to it. Thankfully there is an included adapter if your mic has a different thread size than the one native to the stand, but the adapter is plastic and allows the mic to flop around a fraction of an inch on the end of the arm. You'll probably want to replace the adapter with a $4 metal version also available on Amazon.

And finally, the deal killer: it couldn't hold the weight of either my Blue Yeti USB mic or my Samson CO1U USB mic, especially not with the Samson's shock mount attached. In both cases it just sank to the desk surface like a sad swan with a brick tied around its neck.

If you're working with anything but a really lightweight mic (about a pound or so), I'd really advise going with something more rugged -- and expensive -- than this. Otherwise it's fine, but you could go even cheaper by buying an IKEA lamp of similar quality and just hacking it to hold the mic.",4,1,1.67E-307,2.74E-306,1.43E-306,4.3,16.99,0.099747475,Neutral

Moves smoothly and attaches firmly. Hope it stays that way.

By the way, if you want to use it with a spherical Blue mike, you can, although it's not really obvious how to connect the two. What you do is unscrew the pedestal from the Blue mike, then unscrew the little black plastic adapter that is inset into the microphone holder that comes with the NEEWER boom arm. Use the back of a kitchen knife blade to unscrew it. Then you have an adapter that will mate the suspension arm with your Blue mike, which hangs upside down from the arm.

Looking back through the reviews, it looks like sometime around February they changed the product and got rid of the adapter that would let you fit another shock mount on here. Amazon needs to update what products this is recommended to go with then. I've liked most other NEEWER products I've bought, but this one is a sham so far.

Besides all that: In general it feels kind of cheap and doesn't fasten amazingly well to my desk, but it'd be passable if I could fit my mic onto it. I'm glad I only bought the one...

The design of the stand seems to require the base to be placed on the backside of your desk/table that you will be using. It can go to the side if need be, but the screw that tightens the arm seems makes this tricky. Going into further detail of this, the arm is placed in the base (the part that mounts to your table/desk). Where the arm enters the base, there is a slit on the side that looks like the tightening screw can go into, tightening the arm while allowing you to pivot it. This isn't the case_x001B__x001B__x001B_.well, to mine that is (maybe it's supposed to and mine isn't complete?)

When I attempt to tighten the screw to secure the arm, it doesn't go through that slit in the arm. It brushes both sides and just tightens the arm position, preventing it from pivoting. You can force the pivot, but this will scratch the metal and also rub the base arm along t... Read more",4,1,1.93E-307,3.24E-306,1.79E-306,4.3,16.99,-0.225925926,Negative

It was close enough that cross threading the soft plastic will enable a secure hold temporarily until I purchase an adapter.  Secondly, the slot into which the bottom of the arm slides and is held is very loose. tightening the adjustment screw decreases slack, but makes the arm difficult to swivel at the very bottom.

7017,7023,B00DY1F2CS,A39NBJZA2L23I,"Mostly good, only two things that I would consider 'problems'. The first would be the mount that you use to attach the arm to a desk. It works decently, but the design is just kinda eh. Instead of just a round star knob, there's a ridiculously large T-knob that you need at least one and a half inches of clearance to turn. That's fine if you're mounting it to the front of the desk where you have the giant open space where you sit, but I needed to mount it on the overlap on the side of my desk.

The second problem is the microphone mount. Even with me tightening up the lock nut that keeps the little mounting bar from rotating, it still can't hold the weight of my microphone very well. It works, but the range of motion is limited because I pretty much have to have the mount leaning back against the rest of the arm for it to keep my microphone upright.",4,1,2.09E-307,3.84E-306,2.01E-306,4.3,16.99,0.081779101,Neutral

The design of the stand seems to require the base to be placed on the backside of your desk/table that you will be using. It can go to the side if need be, but the screw that tightens the arm seems makes this tricky. Going into further detail of this, the arm is placed in the base (the part that mounts to your table/desk). Where the arm enters the base, there is a slit on the side that looks like the tightening screw can go into, tightening the arm while allowing you to pivot it. This isn't the case_x001B__x001B__x001B_.well, to mine that is (maybe it's supposed to and mine isn't complete?)

When I attempt to tighten the screw to secure the arm, it doesn't go through that slit in the arm. It brushes both sides and just tightens the arm position, preventing it from pivoting.

Pros
-Cheap
-OK range for the size
-Good range of motion

Cons
-Doesn't hold a heavy mic like the Blue Yeti very well. It'll droop if extended too far outward.
-The base clamp comes loose and unscrewed all the time.
-The clamp on the end that holds the mic is very bad. It droops, and if tightened too far strips the bolt. (I put some thick double sided tape around the round to add some tension. Seems to have worked for now)

The Neewer Microphone Suspension Boom seems like a good value for someone with a standard microphone, but the screw mount is too big to fit the screw hole and the schock mount is too small to fit the girth.

Other issues:

The integrated XLR cable, which would be excellent for standard applications, would uselessly dangle when using the USB connector for the Seiren.

The boom is short. Hooked to the back of my desk, it will not reach to the front.

The mounting hardware looks like someone took a hammer to the side of it. This appears to be a quality control issue not shipping damage. The box is undamaged and the product is wrapped in heavy foam.

The product image on Amazon and the labeling on the box indicate that the product comes with a pop filter. Don't know if that's false advertising or it didn't come with my box.

In short, if you have a standard mic and don't care about quality control issues, this could be a good value. For those with the RAZER SEIRN, ignore the Amazon recommendation and find something else. Not sure what that something else is yet...

Adjustments to the base which clips onto my desk were very easy, probably the biggest positive that I've found.

Other than that, there's only so high of a rating you can give a mic stand that doesn't support your mic.

2 days later this arrives on my doorstep. After opening everything up and trying it out I am not terribly impressed. The scissor arm itself is made out of extremely cheap monkey metal at best. Someone in another review said it is made out of graphite and I would not be surprised in the least. I know I would not trust a expensive microphone in it for long.

Yeah... If you have a desk that is over let's say half a inch thick the included clamp will not fit your desk. My current environment has around 3/4ths-1 inch thickness which this thing has no chance of attaching itself too.

7151,7157,B00DY1F2CS,AQMQ3KTBI8MD3,"I was planning for it to hang horizontally with a Blue Snowball mic, but sadly this one can't function that way.  So, if you wish it to be horizontal, look elsewhere.  I realized this before I attached the mic as it would make little difference of it could stand its own weight, let alone that of a mic.  The Snowball itself is pretty heavy, so I was simply living a fantasy.  As I said, it can't hold its own weight horizontally.  It simply wants to fall.

Vertically it was no problem, even with the weight of the mic.  I am worried about the adjustment in the center.  It seems a bit iffy and wants to give way, but so far has yet.  It's been a week since I've received it and have witnessed not really any flaw that wouldn't be apparent.  It unfolds nicely from its resting spot and folds right back just as easily without even having to readjust it.  It seems more as if it just looks into place whenever I pull it out, so I never have to fiddle with it to get it in the right place.  It just seems to go right where I want it with little effort.

The clamp itself is nicely made, yet just simply done.  It's quite large, so there's little worry if it will fit wherever you decided to attach it.  The clamp is even padded, which calms me to know I don't have to worry about scratching the wood should I end up bumping it in the future.  I was even able to have it fit in a pretty tight spot thanks to the bar's design to slide in and out, making turning it a breeze.

If you do wish to attach the Blue Snowball, do know it comes with the feature to allow this, though it's not apparent yet.  The mic holder that comes with has a piece that screws out.  This can then be screwed into your Blue Snowball and therefore attached to your new mic arm.  Apply some common knowledge when you fiddle with it and you'll figure out how to do the same.

All in all, this mic arm is pretty well made.  It does the job perfectly.  However, I bought it at around $13 from here and I can safely say it feels worth about $20-$25.  It does feel flimsy when you look at it and I am still worried the middle adjustment will drop at any moment.  Therefore, any price above what I've listed feels too much for what you get.  It's also smaller than you may think, so do your research well and have a few ideas on where you are able to attach it that won't be considered in the way in the future.

7155,7161,B00DY1F2CS,A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,"I knew what I was getting before plunking down my money because this is the second model I own. It's identical to a different brand of this stand that I purchased late last year. Complaints about this being a cheaply made arm are accurate, but it's a 'cheaply' priced mount and in this case I feel as though I got more than I paid for it.

Physically this is not large and if you are looking for an arm stand that will extend more than 16 inches this is not going to meet your needs. If you do extend it to 16 inches the height will be fixed at 18 inches off the table or desk top. t will support a relatively heavy mic - I tested it using an MXL 770 Cardioid Condenser Microphone and shock mount. That combination is by no means light, yet this arm stand held it in any position in which I placed the mic. Granted, this is not going to hold a tablet. I have a mic stand adapter for my Samsung Tab 3 10.1 and it was far too heavy for that, but it is not designed for that purpose. And I am sure if you look hard enough you will find some mics that it will not reliably support either, but for me this has done exactly what I wanted.

The clamp will accommodate up to 2.5 inches, and while the screw threads are a little sloppy, it will hold the assembly with mic securely in place.

As long as you are expecting a cheaply made arm, but one that will support a mic and shock mount along the lines of the MXL 770 to which I linked above, this will work. For what you get it's a bargain for the price - as long as you can live with the limitations.",4,1,1.96E-307,3.32E-306,1.82E-306,4.3,16.99,0.117026835,Positive

7200,7206,B00DY1F2CS,A2VYSW6T63JF2W,"I have purchased this NEEWER Microphone Boom Arm twice. The first time I purchased it, the item I was sent differed from the product photos substantially. It was flimsy, lightweight, and wouldn't even hold my microphone securely. I sent it back for a refund.

A few months later I was again looking for a microphone boom and really didn't want to spend $100 on the Rode arm. I decided to give this item another try, hoping the one I received was a fluke. I'm happy to say the NEEWER Microphone Suspension Boom Scissor Arm I received is very nice, holds my microphone securely, and saved me over $85 over buying the name brand item.

I think the first one I bought may have been a previous version that has since been improved, because the connector is totally different than the unit I received when I ordered several months ago.

This microphone arm isn't really heavy duty, but it holds my Audio-Technica AT2020USBi microphone with a shock mount and pop filter attached. It feels a *little* flimsy but even though it moves if I shake the desk, the shock mount (sold separately) helps reduce any vibration or noise from bumping the desk or microphone arm.

My original review is below for reference. If you get one in the mail that just doesn't work, consider sending it back for a replacement before buying a much more expensive option. There could just be a couple of different versions in Amazon warehouses or there could even be a knockoff being sold. Either way, the new mic arm I received works well... MUCH happier with this one. Well worth the price.

OLD Review:

I bought this NEEWER microphone arm stand because of the great reviews, but was pretty disappointed when it arrived. It's extremely lightweight, feels flimsy, and unfortunately wouldn't even hold my microphone (a Samson G-track USB condenser microphone) with the shock mount attached. It was too heavy and I couldn't tighten it enough to get it stable.

This is probably just fine for a lightweight microphone like the one pictured. Mine isn't much bigger, but is solid and heavy. I guess I'll have to invest the $100 in a professional mic arm stand or just be content with the microphone on my desk taking up space.

Returning this stand since it won't even work with my microphone.

Giving two stars instead of one because I think it could definitely work for smaller, lightweight mics...",4,1,1.83E-307,2.81E-306,1.63E-306,4.3,16.99,0.084970096,Neutral

The little compression bracket that connects the short threaded rod (which connects to your mic or mic mount) to the scissor arm structure is super weak sauce. So much so that I didn't want to risk my expensive dynamic mic to this failing.
In the end, I pulled out the little metal tabs that squeeze around the rod and gave them a good squeeze with some wide pliers. I also roughed up the inside of the tabs so that they might possibly bite the threaded rod a little better.

As a final safety measure, I found a length of stainless steel wire and tied it around the XLR connector on the PR40 and tied the other end through the scissor arm structure. Since I squeezed the mic mount tabs, it hasn't budged a millimeter, but better safe than sorry.

I was very impressed with the quality for a reasonable price ('bout $30).
Now I'm setting up a small studio at home and I needed a stand.  I didn't need the spider holder for condenser mics since I'm using a dynamic mic.
So I chose this one thinking it was the same stand.  Boy was I wrong.  This thing is CHEAP and flimsy.  The worst part is where the stand inserts in to the base.  There is no bushing so the stand just flops around even with the nut tightened.  Very POOR.  If this  included a 1c plastic bushing for this I couldn't complaint because of the low price.  I thought about sending this one back and paying $15 for a much better stand.  So I started looking at those too.  It appears that Neewer's quality has really taken a dive.  All of the stand arms appear to be the same as what I have but some come with a XLR  and they are labeled ""broadcast"" quality.

It's odd when you get the box and see that the adjuster wing nut is where it should be, at the part the mic will be hanging from. Yet when you look at the images on the product page, which I had more closely at, the adjustment is on one of the screws on the elbow. This makes no sense to me at all. Sure I can see why you might need to tighten a screw at the elbow but you're more likely going to want to tighten the screw that has the mic mount, if your mic is heavy (as is the case with an ATR2500).

So I choose to move the wing nut to where the mic mounts. I still need to use a wrench or pliers to hold one side of the screw in place while tighten get with the wing nut. Going to try adding a lock washer or something else that might help not having to use a wrench or pliers.
I had thought to move the screw the wing nut was originally on to the mic mount part but it has a squared part before the head which won't fit in the round hole.

I also wish the desk mount had an option to make it a wall mount the way most swing arm lamps mounts do. I have been through a good number of swing arm lamps and usually hang on to the mounts so I had extras I was able to use and the mic swing arm fit right no with no problem.

I use my AT4040 at a desk sometimes and I was getting a little tired of mashing my stage mic stand somewhere between me and the desk. I started looking into one of these boom arms and decided on this one due to the price. Like other reviews state, this arm will work with standard mic mount threading. This means that pretty much all shock mounts will attach to this - you just have to use the little piece that comes attached to the included mic holder. Unscrew it from there and use it between the new mic mount and the metal end of this boom arm and that's all she wrote. Overall I like this product - it's a great solution for podcasting, broadcasting, commentary, or any other kind of vocal production.

| VERSATILE, FLEXIBLE, BUT COULD BE STURDIER
It's fairly versatile, so you can move it around and rotate it, move it up and down and turn it in a wide radius. The clamp is ok, and it's stable enough, but I wouldn't say it's the best out there. You could obviously have better stability and attachments with something from Rode or Heil which I believe make heavier duty boom arms. It's not like it's going to fall off your desk randomly and you shouldn't be hitting it too heavily either, but if you pull on it in various directions enough times and with enough force the clamp might move a bit. That'd be true for anything, though.

| LOW PRICE, LOW STIFFNESS - BUT WILL DO FOR NOW
The joints are relatively stiff but again I'd consider going up to the next highest price bracket for true quality. This one can tend to have a slight sag to it, and by that I don't mean it continually gets lower and lower until it's hitting the floor. I just find myself having to start it out higher than where I need it and it will settle into where I want it. This is especially true if I were to attach my pop filter, where the added weight would do this boom arm no favors. Not ideal, but it's a pretty decent product for a pretty decent price. In fact, that's my overall perception of this boom arm and it's what I'll end the review with.

Mic used- Blue snowball

Let me just start by saying that anything un $20 should be questioned

that being said... THIS ARM IS AMAZING!. I stream for 12 hours a day and this thing DOES NOT MOVE unless you want it to. It stays steady and has an awesome length. It fit my mic perfectly with no issues and the whole thing is made of metal so it's quality. The weight of the mic itself does not cause the arm to drop. It stays holding it up at whatever height (even completely horizontal).

Only one minor drawback that i must mention

where the mic is connected to the arm they should have put on an addition swivel/tilt feature so you could tilt the mic up to angle at your mouth.

7398,7405,B00DY1F2CS,A2DGTXMXB44JF6,"This review is geared for Blue Yeti mic users. The consensus by other Yeti users seemed to be a mix of those saying it works and others saying the mic is too heavy. For $15 I took a chance and as you can see from my included photos it definitely holds the mic.

The mic stand is of average lightweight quality but the joints feel nice and sturdy and no tightening was needed at the main joints. Movement is solid and smooth and once you lock down the moving joints it's quite sturdy. As you can see from my included photos it easily holds the mic at a 45 degree angle, vertical, and inverted with no noticeable sag (although it does have a slight play at the mic attachment point which doesn't really cause much issue.)

The stand doesn't have full swivel movement but it definitely has enough back and forth movement to adjust it to your liking. Take note that the stand itself is of a smaller size with the length of the arm from one joint to another at about 14.5"". Also the base where it clamps down opens to roughly 1.75"" so make sure that your desk isn't overly thick. The stand does comes with an adapter so that you can mount the Yeti with no problems.

Overall, for the price it's a great stand. Since it pretty easily holds the heavy Yeti, it should be even better for smaller, lighter mics (NOTE: I recently purchased the AT2020USB as well and it works well with this mic as well.) The main reason I purchased this was to get rid of the slight knocking noise the Yeti would pick up from my keyboard/mouse use and this stand has essentially eliminated this, even with the stand clamped on the same desk. Great stand, great price, would definitely recommend. As long as you don't buy it with high expectations of a professional quality stand you should be happy.",4,0.697355482,0.00322813,0.048985516,0.028382405,4.3,16.99,0.118385013,Positive

7404,7411,B00DY1F2CS,A2R6FGHV7YCDBN,"I am sending this back today. I wanted to like this. I really did. I record voiceover in a very small closet space, so I thought this small arm would do the trick by helping me save precious floor space. Unfortunately, my mic - the Rode NT1000 - is too heavy to be stable on this arm. In fact, I caught it just in time as it was falling (phew!). Maybe for smaller mics it will work okay, but mics similar to mine just don't have solid ""footing"" swinging on here. Also, as another reviewer suggested, there is an oddity about how the screw fits into the base.  There is an oval shaped hole in the small black metal ""tube"" that holds the screw, giving the impression that the screw is supposed to gain stability by fitting through the hole as you screw tighter. This may be the case if you want the arm to point a certain way (e.g., by screwing the mount the the BACK of your desk) but if you want to have it mounted to a shelf above you, as I did (as I didn't have a choice in the closet), you won't have the stability that the hole affords and was most likely designed for.

Again, for a lighter mic with the arm mounted to the back of your desk, you will probably be happy with this, but in my situation, it just didn't work.  Off I go to seek another solution....",4,0.620336534,0.00334559,0.054167047,0.029176904,4.3,16.99,0.030573593,Neutral

Here is the link to my YouTube video reviewing this item and the two others that are recommended with the Neewer Microphone Suspension Boom Scissor Arm Stand!
Brief summary the Arm is good but I did notice it is not as strong as I'd thought it would be.",4,0.752450746,0.002843131,0.045017293,0.025384238,4.3,16.99,0.377777778,Positive
7413,7420,B00DY1F2CS,ADXZBOKVRZCUV,"The NEEWER Microphone Suspension Boom Scissor Arm Stand. It's a mouthful to say, but it's also a decent stand for the price I paid for it.

The design of the stand seems to require the base to be placed on the backside of your desk/table that you will be using. It can go to the side if need be, but the screw that tightens the arm seems makes this tricky. Going into further detail of this, the arm is placed in the base (the part that mounts to your table/desk). Where the arm enters the base, there is a slit on the side that looks like the tightening screw can go into, tightening the arm while allowing you to pivot it. This isn't the case....well, to mine that is (maybe it's supposed to and mine isn't complete?)

When I attempt to tighten the screw to secure the arm, it doesn't go through that slit in the arm. It brushes both sides and just tightens the arm position, preventing it from pivoting. You can force the pivot, but this will scratch the metal and also rub the base arm along the mount, causing the metal to shave from the grinding of the two. This also restricts the amount of pivoting you can do. It's not much of a bother if you're mounting from the back of your desk, but if you're doing so from the side, it's a slightly different story.

Overall, I can work with it and it works well with my Blue Snowball microphone. It fits perfectly and some others who have answered the questions on this product have shared a video that a gentlemen has posted on youtube, showing exactly how to make this arm stand work with the Snowball.

Pros:
- Great price!
- Is compatible with the Blue Snowball microphone.
- Not too heavy.
- The scissor arm allows versatile movement up and down, while the mounting part that holds your microphone also adjusts.
- Scissor arm will work with pop filters. You just have to find a good spot.

Cons:
- Mount base and arm seem to not be in sync when you tighten it to secure the arm stand.
- Pivoting the arm stand is limiting due to above con.
- Mounting seems to be designed to be on the back of your table/desk. May not be a con for some, but a bit for me as my desk is fully pressed against the wall.

Overall:
Even though I'm having a slight problem with the pivoting and the securing of the arm stand, it still works well and doesn't hinder what it's designed to do. Also, bonus to the Blue Snowball compatibility.",4,1,1.92E-307,3.22E-306,1.79E-306,4.3,16.99,-0.02609127,Neutral

Anyways, I have a Blue Snowball Ice USB mic and a Samson pop filter that I was planning to use this with. As some reviewers have said it was a bit smaller than I was expecting, but still plenty big enough for my desk (1 inch thick wood rectangle desk with flat edges). It came with all the accessories, and no instructions. Instructions are not needed for this though, as it's pretty self explanatory. I took the XLR adapter from the included mic clip, screwed in into the Snowball and then screwed the snowball into the mount on the arm. I then attached the desk mount where I wanted it, and just set the arm into that. There is a screw on the desk mount which looks like its to keep the arm from moving around too much once you position it, but I have a 3 monitor setup so I turn mine when I'm not using it to not block the 3rd monitor, so I just leave that screw loosened. For a final step I zip-tied the USB cable for my microphone to the stand to keep it out of the way. I have not noticed any issues with the arm sagging or anything breaking upon installation. It holds my mic and the pop filter which sticks out a bit just fine. I guess time will tell how well it holds up, but for now and for the $15 I paid I think it was worth it.",4,0.687669431,0.003738294,0.057632145,0.033576404,4.3,16.99,0.110897436,Positive

7442,7449,B00DY1F2CS,A1C9SE8VPFPZCK,"Out of the box the stand looks nice, the finish and apparent quality. But everything about this product is bad, I'll start from the beginning. When I went to tighten the mount the sheet metal (different one than pictured) bent but I was able to get it tight enough. Then the slot in the mounting post was in the wrong place so it was sloppy in it's mount, but it worked. I put my shock mount with mic and it fell forward, tightened up the bolt and nut around the chrome mic stud to prevent it falling over and the the threads stripped but I was able to balance it and it worked ok. I have it mounted on the desk with my mic and it works ok the first few times I use it. Then I go to re-position it and the cup/washer on the mount breaks off, I tighten it without that and the part that holds the mounting post breaks off from the mount bending. I place the mounting post in a hole in my desk and that works for a little bit. Then I notice it's sagging in a weird way and I check it out and the square tubing is bending and the mounting stud is ripping off. I give it a little push and the mounting stud breaks off. Now it's useless, in the trash lasted me using it 3 times a week for a month and a half. Other note is the mic adapter is a plastic possibly 3d printed part but I had no problems with it.

I think a lot of the reviews claiming that you need some adapter to attach [microphone X] are from people who didn't realize you can simply take the mic holding clip off of the silver end of the stand, remove the insert, and use that to mount virtually any microphone with a standard 3/8-5/8 inch inset to the scissor arm. It's made of plastic, but unless you have the fine motor skills of an enraged gorilla, you should have no problem screwing it into your mic. I'm using a Samson Meteor mic and it's holding up perfectly fine.

Even if your mic doesn't work with this stand out of the box, it costs a whopping $15. Use the money you saved to get either a shock mount or the necessary thread adapters.

This product on surface appears to be like any other microphone boom extension, until you put it to work. The clamping mehanism is soooooo sorely lacking that truely a junior high metal shop could create a better clamp as a classs project. It requires CONSTANT adjustment & re-adustment.

Now, other about it things are postive if you can get past the clamp isssue. It's light weight, it appears to be sturdy in it's construction. The included adapter is standard to most professional microphones. It does fit the Blue Yeti ( both pro & usb )

The arm itself is made from light and strong metal (I think it's aluminium but not too sure) it won't bend or flex so it's pretty strong. The vice clamp is made from plastic which I am a bit concerned about at first because it has to counter weight all the force from a suspended mic some distance away, but for the most part it doesn't seem to be flexing or struggling. The vice bit is a little on the small side so I had to really dig it into my desk to get a firm hold and I would recommend everyone wedging something soft so it doesn't chew the desk. I just wedged some packing foam and that seems to do the job alright.
The springs and holding strength are the strong points here. I can move my mic to all sorts of positions and the arm will happily move there without sagging down. There is a great handle to tighten up which is a nice touch. All the joints are held in with bolts so every bit of it can be manually tightened.

REVIEW EDIT: I've bumped this up from 2 to 4 stars. I found a spot on my desk it works well on. I've had to tighten up a few of the screws to hold the snowball but it works ok. The end of the boom (where it slides into the mount) feels very flimsy buts it held up so far. Overall, I think I've got my monies worth.

PRIOR REVIEW:

Sadly this item is unusable for anything beyond a ""tiny"" desk.. I did not realize this mic stand would be so small. For what its worth, the mic stand seems of ok quality. The price of this stand is great as long as you can deal with its ""so small"" size...

The plastic mount that the metal screws into to hold your mic, if twisted nearly to hard, which isn't much, will strip it instantly and your mic will be wobbling around. The second piece having to be replaced is the screw to hold the stand into the desk mount. Not only does it not hold it in place, but also does not fit the hole and has scrapped all the black finish on the metal after the first time screwing it in. (Or attempting to, at least).
Because you cannot screw it in properly, the stand can swerve and move up and down as it pleases not staying in the state you wish it to be in.
I do know this is a cheap product, and you get what you pay for, but at least expected functionality at very minimum.

Going out to find the parts to replace to get it to work, if possible, is probably more trouble then it's worth, being two parts that won't be easy to come by.
I personally will be returning to take my business to a more quality product, even if it means spending a lot more.

I work for YouTube for a Living, creating gaming content and managing a Network, and need my mic to be where I need it to at all times. I can not have that with this product.

Aside from the faults I've listed above, it is well build and if the cheap plastic didn't strip immediately, and mount could be screwed in properly as it simply should be, I wouldn't see this product breaking for at *least 10-12 Months.",4,0.654259801,0.003603163,0.056630017,0.031821837,4.3,16.99,0.041765873,Neutral

7599,7606,B00DY1F2CS,AXUJWU015P9FU,"This is one of the few products to make my ""Hate It"" list. While the overall finish on this stand was nice and even, looks simply couldn't make up for the lack of build quality. The clamp on this arm leaves much to be desired in every regard, not only is it so small that it struggles to get a purchase (grip/bite) on the desk, but the clamp itself is weak when you do have a surface it can attach to. Twice the clamp broke free under the weight of the arm and required intervention.

Unfortunately weakness doesn't end there, but continues up the boom and into the arms themselves. At near full extension the arm struggled to stay up by itself, it couldn't stay up with just a DragonPad pop filter attached. Not surprisingly it couldn't hold a Blue Snowball. Weakness is also found in the adjustment bolt on the arm, even when tightened to max the arm was still collapsing. A large part of this may have to do with the soft (weak) springs used on the arm for support purposes.

Finally at the business end of the boom we find an acceptable mic holder, but attached to it is a cheap thread adapter for use with a Snowball or similar mics. Unfortunately more bad news at this point as the thread adapter itself is another weakness of this boom. Being made of extremely soft plastic the thread adapter was cross-threaded onto the mic holder from the factory, preventing use of it.

At the end of the day, ignoring the thread adapter, the arm itself is useless. Due to the lack of build quality and overall weakness of the arm, it isn't capable of holding a proper microphone. Not being able to accomplish the primary task makes this a worthless item.",4,1,2.10E-307,3.71E-306,1.98E-306,4.3,16.99,-0.028459821,Neutral

The Snowball has a different mounting thread pattern than the stand attachment point and the stand includes a plastic Mic Adapter to adapt it from the threads on the stand to the threads on the mic. The mic adapter screws into the Snowball threads just fine. A good and proper fit. The problem is that the threads on the mic adapter do not match the threads on the stand.

One of the other ""knock-offs"" is from Pyramid. The ABS case is the same but the drivers are off brand and cheap. Also, the Pyle brand has a sturdy powder coated metal grill with the Pyle logo on the front, the knock-offs have nothing on the grill and it's very flimsy. You put clean power into these little Pyles and they respond very well. For inexpensive, waterproof speakers, I recommend them highly.

This has got to be the worst experience I've ever had with Amazon as a whole.

First, as other reviews I've seen (I believe on the .com site), the box was literally destroyed when I received it. When the Purolator guy handed it over to me the box was falling apart. Inside the box was no better, the styrofoam protectors were broken.

As for the speakers themselves, no way are they what they claim to be. I was using them with a 200W Peak 80W RMS receiver, so clearly under the maximum these speakers were designed to handle. Putting the volume up to about 50% of its total capacity, the speakers became distorted and the woofer began ""farting"". I'm sure those with any knowledge of speakers would know what that term means.

Beyond that, I noticed the interior insulation of one speaker was fluttering inside the speaker (noticed through the air hole and not glued properly.

While I didn't expect the best sounding speaker, I would surely expect them to be what they claim to be.

The mids and high's were alright sounding, but these speakers had no sound of bass anywhere, not even the little you would expect from a small speaker.

If you plan to use it outside, you really don't want to hang it vertically, you'd hang it horizontally, and you'd have to tilt it downward.  This would prevent the rain from getting blown into the hole.  In doing so, the knobs that you use to tighten the brackets to the side sometimes slips, so you can't always get it as tight as you want it to be.  Which then makes the speaker gradually slip down completly.

As far as the speakers themselves. I have a Denon AVR-X2200W pushing the speakers (which is a $700 speaker system, so not a cheapy) that pushes them.  However, you really have to crank up the unit for the speakers to get any real volume.  So, I'm not too happy with the speakers. However, they get the job done.  Just wanted something to play some music outside, while I'm out in the yard, but didn't want to get anything crazy where I'd be bothering my neighbors.

7858,7865,B000MCKAU6,A9A6DFLYGWN86,"My company gives you points for a job well done on occasion.  You can spend these points in an online store.  I blew those points on 4 pairs of these.  I do an annual party in the woods, and some cheap weather proof speakers for the sound would save me the trouble of racing around to cover everything with garbage bags should the weather turn.  Plus - I would no longer worry about tree sap on my good speakers.  The sound is fair (obviously needs subs to supplement them), but the quality is a joke.  The tweeters are hot glued into place, and the glue failed on half of them.  3 of the 8 were already loose in side the cabinet upon receipt.  I cracked the cases open to repair.  You have to pry off the metal grill to get at the screws, and you will have to glue the grill back in place.  The specs say ""capacitor crossover network"", there is no capacitor or crossover on board.  They use ""bass blockers"" on the tweeters instead of an actual crossover, so the woofer is actually getting fed a high frequency signal that it can't reproduce.  One of them had the conductor touching the speaker basket on the woofer, so had I tried this speaker before cracking the case open, it wouldn't have even worked.  Half of them had cold solder joints as well.  So - after opening them all, fixing the solder joints, and gluing the tweeters back in place, they finish off as merely acceptable.  Also, the frequency response claim of down to 60Hz is ridiculous.  Maybe @ 1ft/1w, +/- 25dB.  Seriously doubt it was producing audible levels below 90Hz, and roll off likely started at 110Hz.  Specs say ""Unique Spring Loaded Mounting System"", where is this?  It has the thinnest metal bracket I have ever seen, and the brass threads pressed into the case will either push further into the case, or turn in the case making them impossible to tighten.  Specs say ""Removable Rustproof Mesh Grills"", these grills ARE NOT removable, at least not in the sense we would expect one to.  They are glued in place, and you WILL bend them while removing them.  I am glad I didn't pay real money for them, but will continue to use them at the annual party.  If I paid real money, I would have returned all 4 pairs.

Update - I started to prepare for said party after writing this review, and pulled these guys out of the basement.  One more tweeter fell off inside the case, one that did not require gluing last year.  I noticed the tweeter material is all wrinkled like someone stabbed them with their finger.  I inspected the other 7, all the same.  Even if they did get damaged in transport or in the woods, I highly doubt all 8 would receive the same damage.  Question is - did I receive these like this and not notice, or did they begin to rip themselves apart?  Although each pair received different power levels, none rec'd more than 100w (probably more like 75w max - peak, obviously.  Maybe 35-40w RMS).  I am also super anal about distortion, so they certainly weren't played to a level of over excursion.  I have zero confidence in these.  I ordered qty6 VM Audio EX-WOD6's and qty2 EX-WOD8's to replace.  Again, the Pyles were free.  Based on reviews, I would never have spent money on any Pyle product.  These have now solidified that.

In conclusion, based on reviews, some have had good luck with these, some have not.  So I ask you - are you a gambling man?  I myself am, but I lost on this one.  These will be included in the next trip to the recycle center.

These speakers are used outdoors, and are not sheltered in any way.  Given the price point, these speakers cost about $10/yr.

The sound they push out is great, and didn't degrade in my last set until one of the cones finally cracked due to exposure.  I'm pretty sure the sound quality is more limited by my old two channel insignia receiver than the speakers.

7892,7899,B000MCKAU6,A36E7WPWZT6UNS,"A member of my community movie club gifted the club an Epson MovieMate 72 DVD projector. Venue for our bi-monthly showings is a large activity-center community room (comfortably seats  25~30 people.) Problem was, the projector has only 2 internal 5-watt speakers, not nearly enough audio power for this room.

To supplement the two small projector-speakers, I purchased a pair of Pyle PDWR40D 200W speakers and a Pyle PCA3 2X75W mini amplifier from Amazon.  Because the projector provides only a Toslink digital optic audio jack, I also bought a Portta PETDTA Digital Optical Toslink-to-Analog Audio Converter to connect (with short 3-ft optic cable) the projectors Toslink audio-output to the PCA3 RCA audio- inputs.

Although this setup should have filled the room with audio, the result was only marginal at best. I eventually determined that the analog audio output from the converter seemed much lower than line level audio (something the converter specs should address, but dont.) Hence, insufficient audio signal input to the PCA3 amplifier resulted in insufficient drive to the two speakers.

So I then bought a Pyle PP555 Mini Phono Preamp from Amazon and inserted it between the output of the converter and the input to the amplifier; voila, the PCA3 amplifier then boomed out with full-power audio voltage to the speakers, and even with the PCA3 amplifier power knob adjusted to less than  max, the community room became filled with booming audio!

All Amazon purchases above were delivered either on-time or early, worked right out of the boxes, and continue to work great. I give 5 stars for the speakers, amplifier, preamplifier, but only 3 stars for the PETDTA converter (due to entirely insufficient Amazon and manufacturer specs and disclosures on what appears to be below standard audio-level output voltage.)",5,0.668231807,0.009502143,0.096828962,0.075925173,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.154333333,Positive

I do find the highs/midrange frequencies seem overly harsh with these speakers. If you can, use an equalizer to tailor the frequency response of these speakers to your particular environment (as you should do anyway).

The biggest problem I have with these speakers is that the mounting bracket and screws won't let you fully tighten the speakers down to a certain position, at least without putting in some washers. The screws are too long to ever make contact with the surface of the bracket unless you have something in between to make up for the space.

I should have listened to the other reviews but figured they were cheap and worth a try. I was wrong. They are not worth any price and instead just end up wasting time and being a disappointment.

The mounting brackets and construction quality are a huge issue. The side bolts do not hold the speaker tight as the nut inside the speaker rotates freely (check other reviews and you will see the same issue) which means it it not possible to adequately tighten it to hold and if you end up getting it sort of right with the included sticky foam tape then you cannot unmount them because the nut simply twists as you try to unbolt them.

In addition, the mounting brackets on mine completely rusted through and they actually broke in less than 4 months. I am not kidding. These are for outside and are not in the open rain. They do get moisture and humidity from being outside but these are supposed to be outdoor speakers! This is awful.

The sound works but is not good quality. I was not expecting much and that is sort of what you get. They produce sound, not high quality sound but it is sound - the problem is that since you cannot mount them anywhere they are not really worth anything. It is absolutely not worth trying to send them back as the shipping cost is not  worth it. Not to mention that I have no interest in another set.

Advertized at 4 ohm, box says 4 ohm, DC measurement says 6 ohm which is ok, AC impedance came in at 4.8 ohms so they are close to advertized spec.  Thats the only positive I have on these.

7955,7962,B000MCKAU6,A1SKXDK0YKH85N,"These speakers are adequate for the money in terms of their performance, BUT there is a design/manufacturing defect.  The threaded knobs used to secure the speakers to the mounts have threaded rods which are too long for the nutserts in the speakers.  This prevents the user from adequately tightening the knobs to keep the speakers in place. If the user inadvertently over-tightens the knob in an attempt to secure the speaker, the nutsert in the speaker will break loose and just spin. This makes the knob impossible to remove without cutting the threads and damaging the speaker.

So be careful when tightening these knobs.

To get around this, you can do one of two things.  You can add flat washers between the bracket and knob to take up the extra thread, OR you can cut the threads shorter so they don't bottom-out in the nutserts.

On the other set of speakers I bought, the grills were crushed in shipment.  All indications are it is a result of poor packaging.

It may sound like a clich, but this is typical of low-end Chinese products.  Pyle should be more diligent with their quality control and randomly order and inspect their products so the consumers don't get stuck with a dud.

They were hooked to a Pyle PT260A receiver so not over powered by the power ratings. The brackets are make out of super thin metal that is not as heavy as a car tag. The bolts that secure the speakers to the brackets are too long and bottom out far from being tight so no way to mount horizontal.

Now i do have to say the speakers sound good, better than i expected really, but i paid more on another website for these and didn't get what i expected... which was an out of the box working speaker.  Also i must say they're made of soft plastic and mark up easily.  The sticker on the back should say RATED not RETED 300w.  Another thing is the grills are recessed in the front of the speaker, not surrounding the front overlaying it as shown in the photo. The metal brackets are flimsy but suitable to support the weight of the speaker... though they are actually too big and had to be bent in order to tighten down to be mounted... that is actually shown in the photo now that i am looking closer... and those knobs on the sides to tighten them down are hard to use and can strip out the little bolt in the speaker so be careful not to over-tighten.

There are also the words ""Removable Rustproof Mesh Grills"" on the box. However this is not true. My grill covers were glued in and were NOT removable. I even damaged one of the grills trying to remove it.

Others have posted how the brackets are flimsy and the screw knobs do not clamp the speakers in place on the bracket. I concur. I can also add that when I attempted to test tighten the first bracket knob the nut in the speaker housing just turned with the knob, such that I could neither tighten nor loosen it anymore.  After several attempts I was able to unscrew the knob but then the nut fell into the housing! After almost an hour I was able to get the nut back into the hole after removing the approximately four inch square speaker terminal assembly that is screwed onto the back. Not fun.

I also have no idea how the advertised ""unique spring loaded mounting system"" is supposed to work. On the back of the speaker, centered near the top third is an indent in the housing where a flat piece of plastic with what looks a half moon finger hole in it that sits perpendicular to the indentation.  You can stick your finger in the hole and pull the flat piece of plastic out away from the housing about half an inch and it is  indeed spring loaded to pull it back into the housing.  But this piece of plastic does not line up with any part of the enclosed bracket and for the life of me I can't understand what value it provides.

When the package arrived, the packing was thrown in very loosely and the foam was mostly broken.  There was a dent on one of the speakers.  I hooked them up anyway to hear the sound.

The Fishers are just decent speakers so I expected the sound from these Pyle speakers to be comperable.  This was not the case.  I understand that getting good bass in an open area like this is difficult but I expected at least a low to moderate amount of bass. I heard almost no bass from these speakers.

I have extensively compared them side-by side with much more expensive speakers, and they compare very well. Make sure and connect them to a source that has tone controls, because being so small, they naturally put out the highs much more than the low-midrange and lows. To get full sound, they need to be coupled with a subwoofer that can crossover pretty high, like somewhere between 120 and 180 Hz, because these speakers won't give you any tone below that range, so without a subwoofer, you'll most likely be disapointed. However, every speaker this size, and even some a bit bigger, I've tried have the same problem, so this should be expected.

First off the sound is absolutely incredible with very crisp highs and good bass. And when combined with the subwoofers I installed, my outdoor system sounds like you are at an outdoor concert. There is one catch which I had read about by other reviewers. When mounting the speakers to the brackets, the nuts break-away/unglue from the box and drop into the housing. And there is no other way to get at them but to dissasemble the whole speaker, retrieve the nuts and glue them back in with a strong adhesive, which is what I had to do to all four of them. If you are a little handy with a screwdriver then it is not a big problem. But if not, then you have a nightmare on your hands. I had read in other reviews that this was a problem but I just thought that it may have been an isolated flaw. I was wrong. The nuts almost invariably break away.

The biggest issue for me with past headphones has been the discomfort most of them bring during longer periods of use. Not the case here.

I was actually kind of worried because all I knew before ordering this pair of headphones is that Austin on YouTube suggested that this is his daily driver and is worth recommending. I wasn't quiet sure about its true quality and capability until I actually got my hands on the box - it's quite amazing. It's pretty inexpensive and ships to China for free (the brand new option costs too much when shipping to China). Its FR is amazing - 15 Hz to 30000 Hz, which is better than I believe any of my headphones. It's average with a wide sound field, and it's suitable for multiple purposes.

8193,8201,B01BDX1IVW,A2LYN3R7ST9VK5,"Honestly not a bad set of cans for 50 bucks (lightning deal). I had them sitting in my wishlist for many months, not that I couldn't buy these at $63 dollars but I had noticed they went on sale somewhat regularly and I didn't really need another set of headphones, but at $50 I couldn't resist. Just got them today so I can't say anything for longevity, but I have been using them for a few hours now on different devices and a range of music/vocals/games and I'll say this much in summary:

These are fantastic headphones for the price, even at $63, they're a hell of a deal. No doubt.

That being said, they are inexpensive for a reason. They are not for audiophiles. I don't even consider myself an audiophile but my ears are good enough to pick up pops, clicks and errors and I have enough audio equipment to test to see if it's me or what I'm listening to. Knowing that, I'd say these are warm, they have a great soundstage, and they're just very accurate, really makes one feel like they're in the studio listening to the recording while its being recorded. They clearly play all the nice little sounds you don't always get from lesser cans, classics and country music have that a lot and that's what I like, so it's great for that. For that same reason, these are both good and bad for most other kinds of music (highly dependent on your preference and what is being played): it's almost bothersome to have that high accuracy while listening to anything electronic/pop/rock because a lot of that stuff is meant to be very clean, but these guys pick up all the little errors in recording and accent them! Trust me, I say that as I laugh at the thought, as that is more a problem with the artists recording than the CB-1's, alas, maybe that music is not meant to be enjoyed on quality playback equipment? Who knows.

These cans are comfortable. The surface material for the muffs are soft on the skin, the cushion itself is also very soft and overall comfortable, same for the headband. More sensitive people or with bigger heads may not like it as the headband does apply a bit of pressure when left in the same position over time. I have a large head for sure, and they are just so at the max extension, so you have to have a pretty large head or very sensitive to be uncomfortable in these. Due to the surface material on the muffs, they retain heat a bit, so I wouldn't go wearing these while exercising or outside in the heat (might be handy in the winter though).

The styling is perfect, materials feel good for the price. It's all plastic as far as I can tell, but none brittle, well manufactured.

Comes with 3.65mm to 1/4"" jack adapter, and 2 different cables, one spiral, one straight, both feel and look good quality, and as a side note, the 3.65mm jack for whatever your audio playback device is small enough to fit into a galaxy s6 otterbox defender sized port, so take that info as you need it. You may also notice the spring wrap around the connector side to help protect from bends and wear from use, which is a nice feature.

IMPORTANT: It doesn't say so anywhere that I can tell so be aware, there is a locking feature for the male to female connection going INTO the headphones, you just quarter turn it to lock or unlock, DO NOT use force! I almost did but then noticed it. I mention it here because I didn't see that noted anywhere in the packaging, and that seems important.",5,1,1.77E-307,1.87E-306,1.43E-306,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.218137693,Positive

8215,8223,B01BDX1IVW,A29ZO7EB4NTC07,"Update 8/2018: After several months of break-in these are frelling fantastic headphones.  Midrange has cleared up, soundstage is amazing. Highly recommend, but give them some serious break in time for best sound.

Brilliant build quality - fantastic cables - the 3.5mm end for the headset locks in place to prevent detachment.  The end for the device, receiver, computer etc has spring strain relief.

I typically use Grado SR60 or Sennheiser 202's for music and monitoring - these have better imaging and surprisingly better (cleaner, clearer harder hitting) bass than the Grado cans.  Sound out of the box is a bit muddy and compressed - they'll need a week of break-in to get the best results I assume.  Definitely getting some compression in levels right out of the box.  Hope that clears up.

8 hours of break in, still rather compressed through the midrange. Changed CDs and will run another 12 hours.

Extremely comfortable - the ear-cups completely surround my size XL ears isolating me from ambient sound.  Very soft and compliant material. Headband does not press on the top of my XL head (7 5/8 hat size).

For $10 more than the Grado SR 60, I'd recommend these.  For $50+ more than the Senheiser 202, I'd have to go with the 202's, but they only have a single 10' non-detachable cable and have lower build quality.

Summary: Really nice headphones up with some of the better consumer -- prosumer cans I've heard.

They look cool but build quality is questionable, didn't think they would hold up very well (and reviews reveal that's true). The sound is even worse quality than the build. While the highs are nice, the bass is weighty and they have disastrous mid range. Read the reviews at the end for more on that.

Basically these are good for low budget home studio work but I'd still recommend the $70 AKG 240's and the $80 Sony 7506's over these, they beat these by far, it's not even close. Another use would be simply listening to music, not making it. A cheap option if you can't afford Beats.

Reviews from the web . . .

From TechRadar: ""The contours of the mids and bass are ham-fisted, as if theyve been covered by a fine layer of wax. ""

From What HiFi: ""Midrange resonance and bloat causes some unsightly clashes when the right (or wrong) combination of frequencies appear in a song. It turns the meat of the CB-1 sound into dough, resulting in poor separation of vocals from other midrange elements. Timing is sloppy and badly focused, leaving the sound mired in those claggy mids.""

From Headphones Addict:  ""If there is one minor compromise in the sound quality it is the modest reproduction of mid frequencies.
Some of the mids and low mids can get a little lost and feel mushy or muddy for certain instrument or vocal tracks.""",5,1,1.83E-307,1.89E-306,1.47E-306,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.037152778,Neutral

Anyway...Allow me to introduce myself. I go by the alias of ""The Phantom Audiophile"", and, as the name suggests, I am an amateur audiophile, as well as a musician and music fanatic.

Well...let's get down to business, shall we?

Before we get into my routine, super-detailed review, I would like to state that these headphones are, put simply, AWESOME!!!!

So, if that's not enough for you, let's talk about...

SOUND QUALITY:
  HIGHS: Cymbals are crisp and sound realistic, everything is EXTREMELY balanced. Tuned flat. <--- (that's good). VERY balanced sound. Everything sounds PHENOMENAL!  (I will get to the bass later on in it's own section)

  UPPER MIDS: Nothing but more greatness. Balanced, flat sound. You can here everything clearly. Can get a little muddy on occasion. Overall, though, AMAZING!

  LOWER MIDS:  On occasion...they sound kinda muddy. There's not a whole lot to say...the Low mids still sound decent though.

  LOWS: You don't get tons of low end, but what is there sounds good. Once again balanced and flat.

  BASS AND BASS CONTROL: A little to much bass. However, it is controlled very well. The bass has a fast, aggressive, solid punch. Bleeding is prevented very well. VERY punchy bass.

  DETAIL: It's not awful...but it's nothing special. The detail is good...but I've heard better for less $.

  TIME OUT!!
What do I mean by ""flat""?
When headphones are tuned ""flat"" or sound ""flat"", it means that the headphones have a good balance of Bass, Treble, etc.
Here's another way of explaining it:

Neutral: Often referred to as analytical or flat, and generally preferred by audiophiles and audio professionals. Minimal coloration of the original audio signal, accentuating detail across the entire frequency spectrum. Highly musical, but may be perceived as lacking in bass for those accustomed to consumer headphones.

This is the sound signature graph for the Status audio CB-1:

Did that work? The pic should be on there somewhere. If you study the graph closely...These headphones would be considered ""flat"" But their sound signature is actually a little V-shaped. This means that the mids are more bass focussed. The further down the line drops, the more bass there is. The Higher the line, the more clarity elements, like treble.

SOUND QUALITY BOTTOM LINE: EXTREMELY GOOD!  Mids do get A bit muddy on occasion, but overall, they sound GREAT! These are probably the best sounding Closed-back Headphones under $100.

BUILD QUALITY: All plastic. Kind of fragile. VERY nice folding system. Size adjusters have number markings and click into place for accurate sizing.

COMFORT: Personally, these started to hurt me after 20 min. But it's different for everyone.

STYLE/FASHION: These are some cool looking headphones. I kinda like the look of the big earcups.

BOTTOM LINE:

These are probably the best set of closed-back headphones under $100, Great, Balanced sound, GREAT Style.
As a cheaper option, I would recommend the Edifier H850.

With a great source and good amplification, these things have brought me to tears...they are incredibly involving! I was seriously considering a competing closed-back headphone that retails for $1,799 (on sale now for $1,199), but I'm completely happy with the CB-1 and see no need to upgrade further. Really, my only concern is that the headband and ear pads may not last more than a few years. Solution? Buy an extra pair or two, and I still come out ahead. If you have not heard these, buy a pair now. In the unlikely event that they are not for you, they make a great gift. There's simply downside.

I am not a fan of headphones personally, I'm a full-range speaker guy, just wired that way I guess. However there are moments when headphones become necessary.
In looking for a couple of pair for myself over time I quickly discovered that in general, headphones are over-priced, over-marketed, and too often under-deliver. It is interesting that Status Audio feels the same way. When you get down to it most headphones are all plastic or mostly plastic with few exceptions.

When I learned the price of these cans after reading and viewing dozens of reviews all saying essentially the same thing (all very good), I had to get a pair to try out. When I need headphones, I am always attracted to well balanced ones, tight articulate bass, mids with good presence without being exaggerated and non-harsh highs without cliff drops at either end of the spectrum. (I'm looking at you Sennheiser). Of course, the other important aspect is comfort. I like around-the-ear cans with just enough clamping force to be comfortable.

COMFORT
The Status Audio CB-1 is pleasantly light weight with more than ample padding on the ear cups. The ear cup padding is super soft and thick. While the oblong holes look a bit small, my ears comfortably fit inside them and I have slightly largish ears. What is more is that the ear cup pads can be turned to fit. That is a feature not found on most headphones. Headband padding is not anything special, but adequate for the weight of these cans, although a bit more padding would have added significantly to comfort. I don't have much endurance for wearing headphones even with the most comfortable cans, if I can last just under an hour I am doing exceptionally well. Of course, most folks last far longer than I can. I see myself easily lasting about 45 minutes or more wearing these.

BUILD
These cans are all plastic, the only metal on them are the tiny screws and the magnets in the drivers as far as I can tell, but they seem to be fairly rugged. The slide adjustments have good resistance to prevent slipping. The ear cup assemblies articulate a full 90 degrees to front. You can also aim them all the way down so that they point to the outside. These cans also fold up for travel. Two 3 meter cables are included in the box, one is coiled and the other straight. The cable is detachable and the port is a universal design so it can take a cable terminated with a 3.5mm jack. The cables that come with it are terminated at both ends with a 3.5mm jack. They also include a 6.3mm screw-on adapter. The end that plugs into your source is well designed with what I'll call a breakage prevent tip. It is quite a beefy connector with a spring sheath.

SOUND
Per specs, the drivers are 50mm, which is unusual for cans under $100. Frequency range is 15Hz - 30kHz at 32 ohm with an efficiency rate of 97dB, so they are very easy to drive. Status Audio states the sound signature as:Neutral: Often referred to as analytical or flat, and generally preferred by audiophiles and audio professionals. Minimal coloration of the original audio signal, accentuating detail across the entire frequency spectrum. Highly musical, but may be perceived as lacking in bass for those accustomed to consumer headphones.
To me, the CB-1 sounds well balanced, revealing, lows, mids and highs were articulate with nothing overshadowing anything else.

From what I hear myself,  the Status Audio CB-1 headphones should sound like a pair of $50 headphones, but they don't! They punch well above their price point!! These things are very impressive!

The Status Audio CB-1 is under-promised and over-delivered. I find the CB-1 has plenty of bass to my taste anyway, maybe not enough to keep a hard-core bass-head who listens to rap or hip hop happy, but everyone else will find bass to be plentiful and musical with control and finesse. In fact, these headphones overall are very musical, but also surprisingly revealing. They really are monitors! If you like the revealing, neutral, far less colored sound of monitors, you will like the Status Audio CB-1. If you prefer some more coloration or just don't like the sound of monitors, you may not find the CB-1 to your liking. Of course, this is all subjective. To say the CB-1s surprised me is a slight understatement. The CB-1s really sound better than my AKG K7xx and Sennheiser HD518, both which were 2.5 and 2 times the price respectively! It makes me wonder about more expensive cans say 8 times the price of my AKGs or more. In my view, headphones should be closer to neutral and revealing, so why pay a large sum of money for severely colored cans? Anyway, that's just my view.

PROS: 50mm drivers, thick comfortable ear pads, light weight, detachable cable, replaceable ear pads, overall sound and price
CONS: All plastic construction, could do with a little more padding on the headband.

Of course, much of this is subjective as it was my ears doing the listening and your mileage will vary. That said, I never thought I could recommend a pair of sub $100 headphones. However, if you are looking for budget headphones that are surprisingly revealing, I recommend the Status Audio CB-1 without hesitation. Like I said, $60 plastic headphones should not sound like this.

I read tons of reviews which stated these are great sounding and fitting, but for me that wasn't the case. I feel like I have larger than average ears, because the only pair of headphones that don't hurt are the Philips SHP9500. These I cannot wear for a long period of time because my ears starts to become fatigued. Maybe I've been spoiled by the sound of my 9500 as well, because the sound quality of these headphones compared to the 9500 is night and day. I love the wide sound stage and very even sound of the 9500. Nothing is overpowering. With the CB-1, they just sound so narrow to me. They have very little bass well.

8238,8246,B01BDX1IVW,A1KFM64D9FHQMI,"So I bought these after MUCH deliberation and reading tons and tons of reviews on less expensive options to Audio Technica ATH-M50s. I have listened to those many times, and they are stunning headphones. They sound better than most headphones under $300-500! But they do cost $130-170 (depending on the color, and I wanted the white ones), but for how little I use over the ear headphones, it just isn't worth it for me. Maybe at some point in the future Ill treat myself. And since I don't listen to closed ear/over the ear headphones very often, I kept telling myself, its just not worth the money when I rarely will use these headphones. The only headphones I use regularly are my IEMs at the gym.
So I went about trying to find a less expensive alternative that sounded almost as good, but less expensive. Something in the $50-99 range. And after going back and forth on a bunch of options that always had at least one problem, I settled on these Status Audio CB-1s. The reviews all sounded so great and they look great, and the price is great. But I should have known, that 99% of time in life, you get what you pay for, and that is exactly what happened here. Dont get me wrong, these aren't horrible headphones, but the list of things wrong with them for what they cost, and what they CLAIM to be, is just too long.
Many many reviews and the company themselves and online reviews from electronic companies claim they sound almost or as good as the vaunted gold std ATH-M50s. They claim that they isolate sound well. They claim, that even though the bass isn't super deep and rich like the ATH-M50s, that its still very good. And they claim many many more things. And yet, none of those reviews or claims are correct. I don't think 99% of the people that own these and have given them a glowing 5 star review here on Amazon have listened to actual really good headphones. Because if they did, they would never make such audacious claims! I think the 5 star glowing reviews are from people that have only listened to garbage headphones and the std apple iphone headphones that come with their phone.
These are not 5 star amazing headphones by any stretch of the imagination! They are decent. They sound clean and clear. They are a step up from cheap garbage bottom of the barrel headphones, but nothing else. They are weak in the mid bass and bass frequencies, they are weak in overall volume (I had to have my computer, iphone, ipod, whatever) cranked all the way to max, just to get a good listening volume. Its impossible to get these really loud, because they cant get there. The mids and highs are good but nothing sparkling. And the overall sound is just alright, nothing mind blowing or special. The soundstage is nothing special and most of the instruments sound as one. They also leak sound pretty bad. My gf could hear what I was listening to even at moderate volumes from about 10 away. So for an over the ear headphone that isn't supposed to be heard by others very easily, that also isn't good.
The positives are small. They look great. I LOVE the simple non branded look. That look is really cool and anything that has small or no logo design is really cool and an A plus in my opinion. The design itself is also good overall and looks great! The earphones fit over your ear really well and the padding is great! The headband is good for a plastic band, and has only moderate plastic squeaking. The cans fold up nicely and the two cord options are great. Also love the heavy duty looking gold plated jack. Also, the price is good, but they need to advertise these things much differently as it is very misleading. These are NOT on par with any headphones in the 100ish or more region. These are headphones for someone looking to upgrade from cheap garbage headphones. Thats it. Most of these reviews are just so far off of reality. These do not sound anything like good $99+ headphones. I have listened to, or owned in the past over 15+ over the ear headphones that cost anywhere from $80-499, and these don't sound as good as any one of those headphones. I guess my beef with these is not the product itself, but the hype and the reviews. These are great for someone looking to upgrade from cheap garbage headphones. If youve never experienced headphones other than your cheap apple earbuds or some other cheap sounding headphone, then by all means, at around $50, these are GREAT for you. But Status Audio needs to turn their look how awesome I am horn down, and these reviewers need to listen to high quality headphones before making comparisons to real audiophile grade products, as it is very misleading!

8239,8247,B01BDX1IVW,A1YI4SNYAQ6SSG,"Edit: Dropping a star thanks to some new news I found. These are just rebranded versions of the Somic MM185 headphones that you can get off Amazon for $43. Yeah these look cool I guess but not worth $20 extra. I ended up returning these anyways since they changed the ear cushions (I contacted status audio to confirm this. The ear cushions are no longer as advertised.) and they crushed my skull with the clamping force and relatively small ear cushions in general. 3 stars for these. Great audio but they're a +50% price increase for fancy gold paint of another company's headphones. Go buy those instead and save 20 bucks, maybe they'll have nicer ear cushions. I dunno.

These headphones sound amazing. Trust me. They lack bass, but that's intentional. Not very punchy for gaming and honestly leaves a bit to be desired in the bass department. Everything else in sound is phenomenal.

Other than that, they're pretty lackluster. They feel alright but they're not very comfortable. They're clearly designed with quality in mind and they are pretty decent feeling for $65.

The ear cups that I received are not the same as advertised. I asked about it and they said they ""upgraded them"" due to popular demand, and apparently that means making them twice as thick and not conformed to your head. They're just soft bricks now. Not even close to what you see on this listing.

They also clamp rather tight on your ears. They're super light so it's not horrible, but the clamping plus the less than great ear cushions makes them honestly less than pleasant to wear.

OK.  One reviewer compared them favorably to a set of Audio-Technica M50 headphones.  They're not at all similar.  The M50 is a better quality headphone in construction and sound.  Not my favorite, but they certainly are better than the CB-1.  Status Audio's website calls these headphones ""neutral"" in tonal quality.  They're not, at all.

Bass:  Boomy.  The mid-bass is VERY muddy and resonant; 150 Hz or so.  The low bass does extend nicely deep, but the mid-bass dominates the overall tonality.
Mids:  Mostly, fairly clean and clear, though a bit relaxed.  Some people will like that, but I need a present midrange.  Midrange is 90% of what we hear!  It's hard to tell what's going on in the mids, though, since the mid-bass is so dominant.

The earpads are soft and comfortable and do not get hot after several hours of continuous use.
These come with 2 interchangable cords and a 1/4 inch adapter plug. One cord is coiled, the other is straight.

BAD: the pleather wrapping around the headband looks and feels a little cheap.
These fit, but just barely. If my head was any larger, or these headphones any smaller, they would not cover my ears. I measured over the top of my head from earlobe to earlobe and it is 47cm/18.5in",5,0.668895593,0.009588685,0.096260786,0.076550992,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.234375,Positive
8245,8253,B01BDX1IVW,A321Z2DEK5FWB9,"I purchased these based on the many reviews I had read that was praising them for being great reference headphones for audio work. The first thing to know about them though is that they're absolutely nothing like the M50's from Audio Technica. Listening to the two side by side will initially make you feel like the CB-1's are really flat, almost too flat and lifeless. By comparison it's like the difference between the ""flat"" and ""rock"" EQ setting on most any boombox circa the 90's. In other words, the M50's are scooped sounding but a much more exciting headphone to listen through.

However, once you have that information and can think past the hyped sound of the M50's the CB-1's do sound pretty good, especially at their price point! So if you're looking for a flatter response set of phones that can give you a better idea of what's happening in your mixes, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",5,0.768693151,0.006601172,0.067567551,0.052837627,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.2475,Positive
8246,8254,B01BDX1IVW,A1TNWD6DMYLE89,"They arrived the other day on time. Purchased these to use when I need to be quiet when jamming. I love to use the Aux and Earphone jack on my amp to plug in my iPhone and practice leads to blues backing tracks without disturbing the whole household, but I digress. Anyways, they have a snug & comfortable fit. They won't fall off if you move around a little. The cords are nice too, the Aux/Earphone jack ends are shielded with springs to help prevent fraying. Nice touch. They come with a straight cord and a curly cord and an adapter so you can use 1/4"" or 3.5mm jacks. The build quality seems solid and I expect them to last a long time since I won't be taking them out of the house. They come in a decent box with a molded insert so you can keep it for storage. Again, nice touch.
  As for the sound quality: The closed backs seal out/in the sound well. The highs and mids are fine and clear. However, depending on whether I'm using the bridge pick up vs. the neck pickup I did notice that the low frequency gets a little muddy on the low ""E"" string starting from the ""A"" (5th fret) on down but it's acceptable for practicing. For the price point they fit my needs and I'm satisfied. If you are a super audiophile using these for professional recording you may want to step up a level or two.

8248,8256,B01BDX1IVW,A26O1G5LH2VEC9,"I came to these after having used 2 gaming headsets (G430, then Arctis 3). Both of them had issues with the cable connections that led me to buy the next pair (no soldering skills here...). Average use for these 2 previous headsets was 2 years with extended  game times. On average 3 hours a day during the week and maybe some 6-7 hours on weekend  days... wife permitting.

For gaming? Really? HECK YEAH! In comparison, the CB-1 has an outstanding sound signature by comparison to my 2 previous headsets mentioned above. Though they were not top end hardware, they were no slouches either and are among the most commonly used headsets these days. The best part? THIS COMPARISON WITH THE CB-1 WAS RIGHT OUT OF THE CB-1 BOX WHICH CAME IN LAST NIGHT! Everything sounds crisp and detailed with good positioning sound stage which is a must in any game. I played an ""older"" game (SWTOR) which I consider not to be at the same audio level as newer games of today. Wonder how Wildlands will sound? Hmmm... The CB-1 admittedly does not have a mic but there are enough options to help out out there that this should not be a concern.

What about music though? Well... I have a few IEM's against which I made my comparison and WOW! I am hearing details like never before. I even have IEM's that I consider ""borderline audiophile"" IEM's (I am no sound expert so I don't feel I need the expert hardware). I am now hearing details I hadn't heard before without having to spend a ton of money, which was the best part for me. Spent less than some of the IEM's I have (sigh). These 'phones are pocket-friendly and audio-engaging.

Build quality? Light. Comfortable. Slight head pressure but they are still new. I assume they will loosen up with time but I don't mind the pressure. It is just enough to insure a full closure of the pads onto my head even when wearing my glasses (which are not pushed into my head with these stock pads). I will say though... they do feel a bit on the ""fragile"" side but I am guessing that's part of the formula to get them to be so light and comfortable. Just make sure you treat them with a loving hand, don't throw them around or into a back pack (not travel-friendly IMO) and you should be OK. Is there a need to change the pads? Not IMO. The pads, even though not of memory foam, are amazingly accommodating and make a good closure for an enjoyable listening session. If you can find replacement pads of your liking and want to spend the cash... do it. You can always come back to the stock pads. Just think of how you will cope with the guilt feeling of having spent cash unnecessarily ;-p .

Speaking of time... I believe these 'phones will physically loosen up over time as I already mentioned above. I also know that the drivers will also loosen up as well so the best sound is still yet to come! Remember, I only got them last night! But, should something happen to these 'phones the price point is such that replacing them (if not by warranty) will not be a hard thing to do. These are pocket-friendly after all. I wouldn't have minded to pay full MSRP on them.

Hope this has helped any of you wondering if it's worth making the plunge into buying these. If you are not an audiophile and cam keep good care of your things... just do it. You will not regret it.

8252,8260,B01BDX1IVW,A2XK457967V0DD,"First I want to just state that in terms of value for the money, these are incredibly hard to beat. However, they are in no way comparable to the ATH-M50. I bought these hoping they'd be close and they're not.

The Good:

-The highs are crisp and tight. The overall presentation is hard to beat and definitely outpaces the 30s and 40s from AT

-They are comfortable. Big ear pads make them easy to wear for long periods of time.

-The construction is robust, i can see these lasting for a while.

-The Cables included are well built and the spiral cable included is perfect for NYC subway cruising and commuting.

-Customer service and return policy. I have returned these, as they did not meet my expectations but the return policy and customer service is second to none. Also the fact that you do not have to pay return shipping is a godsend. Truly a great company that cares about it's customers.

The Bad:

-The midrange is cardboardy and the bass, to my ears, is artificially boosted and sloppy. The bass lacked pacing and tautness compared to what I like. Quantity won over quality in this case. Keep in mind a really need a flat set of headphones in terms of frequency response, which my much more expensive AKG K612Pros excel in, so if you're a bass fan and prefer deep lows and sparkly highs, and won't be mixing on these, definitely give them a look

-They are huge! As far as a headphone for commuting and on the go you end up looking like an old school air traffic controller. I have a big head and these still dwarfed my huge melon.

Are the CB-1s worth it? Absolutely. If you want a great sounding set of headphones for monitoring use in the studio or to watch movies and enjoy music with, I can't think of a better pair, and can say these can go toe to toe with headphones costing $100, but are they a world beater, or an ATH50 beater? No, they're not. I ended up returning them as they were just too big and too boosted on either ends of the frequency spectrum for me, but considering how easy the return process was and the real quality and value these headphones show, I give these a solid 4 stars. If you have the money and don't care about flat frequency response, definitely consider the CB-1.

I always like those headphones because they were ""neutral"" sounding; meaning that they weren't meant to emphasize any particular sound range like bass or treble.  This means that you hear the music the way the artist intended for you to hear in when they mixed it in the studio.  This new one was more comfortable due to the additional cushioning.  Of course, his had the same problem my Sony's had, in that the headphones were mostly plastic, which meant there was a lot of squeaking when you moved your head around a lot.  Also, these were more expensive than the Sony's, but probably because of the added cushioning.

Are they as good as high end headphones?  No.  If you spend $200-$300 on headphones, you will (usually) hear a remarkable difference.  Then again, if you have those headphones, you should be pairing those with a high end PC or high end audio equipment.  But are they good for thier intended purpose?  Yes.  These are great when paired with your phone, tablet  or laptop (I was going to say MP3 Player, but who uses those anymore).  These will definately satisfy the need for neutral sound without over spending.

I don't care how good a set of cans might sound.

8280,8288,B01BDX1IVW,A2QGDRQTKTVZ2F,"I wear glasses in a home studio setting, used primarily for mixing/mastering as well as live instrument and vocal recording monitoring.  I picked these up from a recommendation by a fellow musician (I also have a set of Audio Technica ATH-M40fs that I've used for years).  I find that the Status Audio CB-1's are much more comfortable - they feel lighter than the ATH-M40fs yet they have larger drivers (the CB-1's have 50 mm drivers whereas the ATH-M40fs have much smaller 40mm drivers).  Frequency response on the CB-1's are slightly better than my old cans, but likely not an audible difference in spectrum.  The additional low frequency due to the larger drivers in the CB-1's are most certainly noticeable though, and I appreciate that.

I wear eye glasses, and long listening sessions with my old ATH-M40fs can prove challenging.  The Audio CB-1's have a much more comfortable grip around my ears while wearing glasses, and the padding is at least 40% better than my old cans.  I originally bought my  ATH-M40fs because they had field serviceable pads and wires, but these are primarily used in a home studio and I've never needed to replace them.  Anyway, it should be mentioned that no matter how comfortable your cans are, if you wear glasses, you'll eventually get that pinched/pain on your ear lobes after some time.  It's the nature of the beast, I suppose!  The CB-1's are no different in that regard, but I do seem to get a bit more longer time with comfort than I did with my old ATH-M40fs.

Overall, these cans sound great.  Their response is flat (as studio cans should be), but accurate.  The 50mm drivers are sublime, and build quality is acceptable for cans in this price range.  Seriously, at this cost - you could do far worse!

Sound was decent for the most part but suffered a lot at lower frequencies. For example, it struggled pushing clear rich sound for drum beats unless I changed my equalizer settings. Another big issue was poor grip. The right slider was basically stuck but I I didn't care too much since the left worked fine and I was able to adjust the length. Perhaps this is why it didn't sit snug on my head. On a related note: asked my officemate if he could hear me and he said he could starting at Windows volume level 14.

8291,8299,B01BDX1IVW,A15KRN6DN336PU,"I purchased these for use in the office, and they've been more than capable of drowning out workplace white noise. Because my head is apparently shaped like and just as delicate as an egg, I generally prefer suspension headbands, but the padding, ear cup tension, and overall weight of these headphones due to an apparently all-plastic build has actually resulted in a comfy fit that doesn't feel overly heavy or tight. A pressure point still starts to form on the top of my head after a few hours of wear, but considering I immediately feel uncomfortable in other popular headphones like the ATH-M40x and MDR 7506, a few hours of pain-free wear is a big improvement.

I'm not an audiophile by any means, but the sound is, to my untrained ears, balanced and warm. Highs are clear, but not tinny or and the bass is present, but not muddy-- definitely sounds better than my Steelseries gaming headsets. I find myself enjoying the music I listen to, rather than experiencing it as noise that's slightly more pleasant to listen to than keystrokes and mouseclicks.

Nice touch that the adjustments are numbered and notched so that you can always adjust them right back to that perfect fit if someone else uses them.
The neutral:
Its important, if you're a casual music listener such as myself, that these are studio headphones. The cords are longer, heavier, but very well designed to last longer and take a little more abuse like being pulled on.

The sound quality is extremely great! The softness on the ear pads feels like good quality, and the audio jacket clips on perfectly. What's great is that any other audio cable works. You could even get a bluetooth adapter if you really wanted it.

The headphone are extremely solid.
,
So, why the 4 stars? Well... the sound is amazing, the quality is great, but I feel like they cheapped out on the headband. Before getting a replacement, I had an issue with the right leveler not staying put, and I also was having head stuffness.
After getting a second replacement this issue was fixed.... except my head hurting.

The company has said that it can take a while to get used to the headphones, but I digress. The longer I use them, the more the pain. I actually use headphones a LOT of the time, so this really puts me off.

If it wasn't for the headband that feels like the strongest plastic foam in the world, then this would had gotten 5 stars all the way.

8318,8326,B01BDX1IVW,AJSLKJGQPQIZX,"I'll start by saying, I'm not a trained audiophile but have always had my hand in the home theater/car audio world. After finishing my home theater system and realizing I can come no where close to utilizing it in my condo (sorry neighbors), I thought I'd look for a decent pair of headphones to enjoy music. After a ton of research and reviews, I discovered Mass Drop and picked up a Schiit Audio DAC/Amp stack and a set of Sennheiser HD650 (HD6XX) open back cans. Unfortunately the 650's won't be here for 2 months so I thought in the mean time I'll pick up a cheap set of closed backs. I'll need a set of CB's anyway. Man am I impressed with these! The frequency response is incredibly smooth throughout the spectrum. Bass response rolls off well below 20hz. Not a bass-set of cans, but clear and true to the recording. The mids are pleasant and smooth, but not ultra detailed, which may be the only downside to these headphones, but even then, I only noticed when comparing side by side with a pair of borrowed NAD HP50's ($180 cans). The NAD I think were almost painfully detailed in the mid range, like someone knocking on your skull. Comfort... I've had them on for an hour and almost forgot they're on. Like pillows around your ears. Lastly, the best part of these cans, the soundstage is huge! Really excellent separation due to the thick pads and deep cans. The NAD's had almost no soundstage when comparing (and they are also extremely uncomfortable). 2 included quality cables (straight/curly).  Bottom Line - Buy These Headphones!

I'm very happy with their customer service and hope to be wearing some Status cans again in the future, once I'm confident any driver issues are ironed out]

Can no longer in good faith recommend these Status CB-1 headphones. The first time I purchased these (April 2017) I loved them - the soundstage is fantastic and overall very clean, neutral sound. Best sounding pair of headphones you'll find under $100... when they work. After 5 months of use in October 2017, the low end completely disappeared due to both drivers failing. Status promptly sent me out a replacement pair that month and I'd been using them happily until this month (January 2018).

Now, the replacement pair they sent me is having the same issue but in the right driver only. Low end is missing, making it sound like the audio (and low frequencies) are heavily panned left. The headphones are unusable. This is a real shame as I really wanted to love these headphones and have (sadly) recommended them to several friends who are now also having issues. Obvious quality control issues + low quality components being used to meet that low price point.

Will be sticking with Sony MDR7506s from now on at this price point. Similar sounding but I've had pairs half a decade without a single issue.",5,1,1.78E-307,1.91E-306,1.43E-306,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.189169884,Positive

But they are cheaper, more comfortable and better sounding in the same price range.

Update to review:  I just bought another pair ($20. cheaper than when I first bought them).  Forgot to mention in my first review that the headphone material showed no signs of wear at all after nine months use. They broke because I kept on dropping them, which also caused my previous Audio Technica phones to break, but they broke after about 3 months instead of almost a year for the Status Audio pair.

One, sound leakage. The headband is plastic, so it doesn't clamp well around your head and provide a good seal around your ears. Two, build quality. There isn't a piece of metal anywhere on these cans. They are all plastic.

They got pretty rave reviews across the board that for the price, they were pretty fantastic. And Im sure for other uses other than VO, theyd live up to these high marks.

I bought these for pretty exclusive use for play back and editing in DAWs such as Pro Tools and Audacity. I noticed that the mids seemed a bit muddy, but thought it might improve upon Normalization of my audio. It didnt. So its very hard to get clarity on audio that you are straining to hear, to edit out mouth sounds, breaths, and ambient noise that you're not sure if you're truly hearing or not.

And on top of that, Im at the last click on the width of the headband, so the closed back headphones are just barely enclosing my ears. And I don't even have that large of a head. That doesnt help with sound isolation, so I furthermore lose hearing another set of sounds which could make it so that I could lose a job, turning in audio for an audition that I think is clean, when in reality it has all sorts of hidden treasures in it.

Again, Im sure these are great for gaming or even just listening to music, but they are pretty bad for the sole purpose I purchased these for.

8385,8393,B01BDX1IVW,A2VCP0XSV32SYN,"These are sturdy, well crafted phones, with accurate bass and slightly rolled back treble response. But that isn't quite enough to recommend them for pro use.
The ear cups are much thicker than displayed in photo here. The phones themselves are clunky, they do settle on the head comfortably after a while. Unfortunately, the sound quality is as boxy as the design. Reverb and hall sounds, especially in the upper midrange, are emphasized. There's also too much mid bass, making baritone vocals, congas, and toms sound tubbier than normal.
My comparison phones are Beyerdynamic DT770s, the long-reigning industry standard-everything you look for in a studio monitor headphone. Switching from the Status to the Beyerdynamics was like turning the lights on in a museum.
The CB-1s also require clean quiet power from a good DAC or headphone amp to sound their best. You're not going to get away with plugging these into your computer or cheap mixer headphone output. At which point one has to ask if it isn't just better to invest in really good monitor headphones in the first place, like the Beyerdynamics, which have lately dropped in price, or perhaps a pair of Audio Technicas. There's buying on a budget, then there's buying smart.

8386,8394,B01BDX1IVW,A3L952YXYPR01X,"The sound is clear and fairly flat across the frequencies.  I did not notice any muddying of anything: Eminem, Taylor Swift, Leann Rimes, Johnny Cash, Mariah Cary holiday music, and a few different tracks of EDM (ATB, Tiesto, and Andain).  I am not a bass head, but I did find myself wanting to activate my EQ on my laptop/iPhone/iPod (ALAC, AAC) to add a bit of bass........because the headphones do NOT fit snug enough.  I am a hat size 7 and they just don't clamp down enough.  Sitting on the couch and casually turning side to side, left alone up & down made them move noticeably.  Manually pushing the cups into my head showed me that better isolation would be perfect, and that the cushy pads are awesome.  Also, my ""normal"" sized ears didn't touch the interior of the speaker liner, or rub anywhere on the pads.  The plastic of of the headphone overall gave almost zero squeaks, which to me is impressive.  The cable connector to the headset is not small, but metal w/a wound exterior spring for cable strain relief.  Also has threads for the 1/4' adapter (nice).  The other end of this coiled cable is a small-medium sized plastic connector.  I also tried a 3rd party iPhone w/mic cable and it plugged in and worked just fine, good snug fit into the headphones.

The only other issue I have, and why I ultimately gave it a 3 star and will be returning this is because the pleather wrapping around the top headband was ripped.  Someone at the factory missed it.  As the photos show, the wrapping is wrinkled and bunched a bit since it is wrapped on a rectangle tube on a curved frame.  It looks like the pleather is VERY thin and prone to tears to be honest. Electrical tape would fix any tears, but I don't want to fiddle with brand new headphones.  FYI: The tear is not where the 2 twist ties hold the headphones together in the plastic retail packaging.  The retail box looks & feels like super fancy high end headsets, so kudos for the great looking packaging.  IF they fix these 2 issues for me, I'd give them 5 stars.

8443,8452,B01BDX1IVW,A3JL3LERQUTJ1X,"I actually bought this headphone out of curiousity. While I was looking at headphone reviews, this particular one was praised by many reviewers. Almost all of them said this headphone was one of the best sounding set of cans for that price. And since it wasn't that expensive, I decided to take a shot.

As everybody already mentioned, this headphone has poor build quality. It wasn't their focus in the first place, and I already knew that when I decided to buy this headphone, so I can't complain. Switching the cable was a bit awkward though. It has a lock-in mechanic where you have to turn and then pull. But even after turning the cable, it is quite hard to pull it out. I thought I would break something if I used too much force, but after knowing how to do it there is no problem.

The sound though is great, considering the price. I mean come on, it's under $80 dollars. You get real quality sound with the CB1s. The headphones that comes closest to sound quality I think is the ATH M40x and those are around $90? Though for the extra money you will get better build quality with the M40x.

This headphone is also quite comfortable. The pads are big and squishy and the headphone itself is light.

If you don't have enough money for the M40x then this is a great choice! Even if you do have enough money, maybe it's better to use that extra money for a dac/amp combo?",5,0.660161316,0.009514988,0.099744,0.0763098,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.192788462,Positive

The sound quality for the price is truly exceptional, especially if you're looking for nice prominent lows that aren't muddy.

The headphones are light, and don't clamp too much. This means that they're comfortable over long listening/gaming sessions. The pad are massive and lovely, my only (and very mild) gripe being that the earhole is slightly too small for my ears and presses on my lobes or top of my ear. However, this is a problem I have with almost all stock headphone pads, and compared to anything but some Brainwavz replacement pads I'm fond of these are the best.

The sound quality as I've mentioned is fantastic, I own several other pairs of closed-back headphones in various price ranges and it matches up very well with them. It has more prominent lows than the MDR7506s or the ATH-M50s, but not to the point that they're overpowering.

The no-frills detachable 3.5mm cable is a nice feature, and allows me to take any cable I want (including the vmoda boom pro I'm using right now) and roll with it. I've also abused this to take the cans with me on the go, since I can just detach them from my desktop cable and attach them to the coiled cable that comes with them.

I was lucky enough to pick them up on sale when they were down to $63, and at that price I'd urge anyone looking for headphones to consider these.

I am no highly experienced audiophile, but I have been using expensive, overpriced, easily broken and underperforming gaming headsets for years across all platforms. What I have come to realize is that the gaming headsets aren't the way to go. For the best value and the perfect sound, you really need to pick up a pair of headphones like these and add a mic. They sound really, really good. By that I mean they sound clear, real, and not too crazy in any particular part of the EQ except maybe a little ""bright"" with the higher pitched sounds.

If I had to say there was one thing I was disappointed with, it was probably the bass. I know these aren't beats or some nasty gaming headset and aren't designed for huge bass, but a lot of the reviews made it sound like it was definitely booming compared to so many other headphones. I honestly didn't find this to be the case at all. The bass is there, it's kind of punchy,  it's probably as others have said ""accurate,"" but it's not anything that will impress you and it's certainly nothing you will feel. I guess I just expected more bass from all the hype I heard leading up to my purchase is all.

That said however, these are really very good headphones. If you play around with your EQ settings I think you'll find you can bring some of the bass out, it's just never going to knock your socks off. That's not what these are designed for, and that's okay. I was just hoping for more bass for gaming purposes as it's more impressive in that circumstance.

I came from an Astro A40 with mixamp setup for my gaming and aside from the loss of the rumble and bass, these things destroy the A40s in every other way. After only a year, my A40s had a busted headband (cheap plastic tabs), and a mic that everyone complained about online constantly. The A40s also rattled and slipped around on my head, and I have a big dome.

If you want a top quality gaming ""headset"" that beats the most expensive purpose built gaming headsets on the market today for literally a fraction of the price, pick up a set of these and add in a V-Moda BoomPro mic and you're done. It's painless to setup, sounds great, and people online tell me the mic is hands down 1000x better than my Astro A40s ever were. You can't go wrong with these unless you want the showstopping boom to your bass or a massive sound field for gaming.

Using headphones ot experience very high quality sound has become my way of enjoying my music now.  I've owned a number of headphones over the years with some costing nearly five hundred dollars.  Honestly the CB-1s and OB-1s are my favorite of all time!  They are definately different and I enjoy both for different situaitons.  When working in my office, I'm a photographer, I use the OB-1s becasue I love the expanded sound stage, when in a room with others, or on a plane,  not wanting to disturb anyone with my concert level sound, I use the CB-1s.  Both are close to flat across the specturm but still have good bass, just not sloppy like Beats, the mid and upper frequencies are near perfect to my ears.  I find them both comfortable to listen to for long sessions, at least a couple of hours and I never  have fatigue as I do with some other highy regarded units.  If you are listening to headphones in a store and find some that sound amazing, often, over time they will wear you out,.  The Status headphones are articulate but never tiring, and I find they reproduce instruments and voice nearly perfectly!

8490,8499,B01BDX1IVW,A3SFC96V4ADXFN,"I'm going to be frank, I hadn't heard of Status Audio before sometime during May of 2017, and when I did I was immediately skeptical. A company that sells high quality headphones at affordable prices? It seemed to good to be true, so I researched the company and found a very small handful of video reviews on YouTube for he Status Audio CB-1'S. They seemed promising, studio monitors for $79.99, not bad! So I ordered a pair and waited.

 I chose expedited shipping, however, I made the mistake of ordering on what was essentially the weekend, so of course there was a small delay in fully processing my order and shipping it out. I researched a bit more and found some somewhat negative reviews amongst the otherwise mostly positive customer feedback for Status Audio, noting that customer service was spotty and that shipping could be a pain if you ordered directly from Status Audios Website. I got worried. Despite this all, I eventually learned that the customer service representatives at Status are some of the nicest and most helpful folks I've ever the pleasure of dealing with. Not only did they provide updates to every step of my order, but they went above and beyond and gave me shipping estimates before I received official word from the company. This is something I've NEVER gotten from any company, and I think it's awesome.

 Onto the headphones themselves, the CB-1'S have been compared to various studio monitors both in, and beyond it's price range. I myself have only had experience with Sennheiser and Sony models through the years, and these cans are just as good if not better. The soundstage is wide and balanced. Highs are bright and shiny, the bass is clean and sufficiently thumpy, and much to my surprise, the mids cut though it all and hold their own. Ultimately, studio monitors are made to reproduce music as it's originally intended to sound. Your setup and EQ settings will color the neutral sound these headphones produce, that's what I've done and the results are darn good. I don't use any sort of amp or preamp, and honestly, these headphones don't need one. Status Audio has managed to make an $80 pair of headphones as good if not better than many others three times it's price.

Like a dac and amp for example. Most reviews talk about the quality of music with these so I'll talk about it for those interested in using these for gaming purposes.

These work really well if you're going to go with a closed headphone. Not as good soundstage wise as say the Superlux 668HD but pretty close, and you get a good deal better audio quality(think being able to tell the type of vehicle from a distance with just sound, or hearing footsteps as soon as the audio can kick in for them) and then they are super comfortable out of the box for a long play session(which is not the case with the Superlux). Obviously in-game music sounds better on these. Pair these with a Mod Mic 5, V-Moda BoomPro or say a Blue Snowball and you have a setup that is miles better than any headset you can buy(just don't forget a pop filter if it doesn't have one). I compare these to the Superlux because after buying good pads for them the end up being the same price, and between the 2 I'd take these.

I own quite a few 'decent' headphones with a basic dac/amp setup - Sennheiser HD 600, Oppo PM3, Shure SRH 1540, Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro, AudioTechnica M50x, RHA T20i, Bose QC35, and the Soundmagic E10. The CB1 produces a level of clarity and precision comparable with older established players in the market. The mids and highs are precise and crystal clear. The lows are quite present without being overwhelming, and the bass is tight and punchy. These have effectively replaced my everyday headphones (which used to be the M50x) purely due to their neutral and accurate sound reproduction. Whatever Status Audio did to design and build the drivers for these cans, hats off to them!

Now talking about what you get for the price -  the pads are quite soft and rest well around your ears; not exactly comparable to pads made from alcantara or velour, but pretty comfortable nonetheless. The build quality is decent - it isn't meant to take a beating, but pretty good considering the price tag. Treat them with care and they could last you a couple years.

These headphones are incredible. Amazingly comfortable and I can wear them for hours on end without any fatigue. If you're thinking about buying these next to a pair of ATH-M50x or M40x, I would definitely purchase these instead of those. I would like to make it clear that I am not an audiophile, but I do value sound. I normally like a more V-shaped, meaning more emphasis on the lower and higher end sound signature for the type of music I'm into which is more of a heavy rock and rap sound. This pair of headphones is very neutral, meaning that it's pretty flat across the board for the lows, mids, and highs. Even though I am a more V-shaped person, the flat sound that these headphones produce is AMAZING. You can really and truly hear EVERYTHING. The sound warm and wide and just incredible.

Mercy. This is some quality headphones. The ear cups are soft and everything is peachy. Its plastic, but doesn't feel like cheap plastic and although its fairly new, I'm sure if it is taken care of, it will last.
As it relates to the sound quality: AMAZING. I originally wanted, as everyone did, some Audio Technica, but caught these on a sale and not disappointed. The Mids are mixed well with the treble and bass as there is not really one over powering the other. Maybe there could be a tad bit more on the treble's end, but overall it is a good mix and clear rich quality. Can't say there is no sound leak at all, but it is very minute.

8525,8534,B01BDX1IVW,A2KCNRFE5NL5B6,"I will start by saying I am NOT an audiophile; I just like nice sounding headphones. My ""collection"" of cans and earbuds consist of V-Moda M100, V-Voda Crossfade LP, Apple Airpods, Bose QuietComfort 20. I like earbuds for my daily commute (NYC subway) and nice over ear headphones for home TV media and PC media and gaming. Recently, I wanted another cheaper pari for my PC as backup to my M100's and I thought the CB-1's may fit the bill. Wow, they are great.

Keep in mind that these are great FOR THE PRICE. They sound fantastic. Not like my V-Moda's but great nonetheless. Bass is punchy (not muddy) and the highs are pronounced. I really enjoy the sound. Not too much of anything and just right. Great sounding monitors.

They do NOT cancel out sound very well. My V-Moda's create a much better seal around my ear. I believe that because the CB-1's have such a thick cusion around the ear, it allows more sound to travel in. However, because of the thickness, these are very comfortable.

My gripe with these is the quality. I knew that they are cheap but wow, these are cheap feeling. Plastic for everything. I feel that if I drop them once or twist them just slightly, that they will break. I am not confident tha these will last more than 6-12 months, but for sixty bucks I am okay with that. Additionally, the pleather around the headband is so thin. A tiny scrape of anything would quickly tear this fake leather; and then peeling would start. I am extremely careful with these and hang them up after every use. These would not be good for travel or everyday use (like my trusty M100's).

I cannot stress the importance of the price. I would not pay anymore than sixty for these. Anything higher and you should look elsewhere. I also would strongly suggest these be used very delicately and hang or put away when not in use to prolong the life. Otherwise, at sixty buxks, these are a no brainer.

Comfort: Fairly light set, making it very comfortable and easy to adjust.
Perceived quality:Time will tell. Maybe some aspects could be made a little more robust, but for the price I think it's expected and fair.
Sound: Had high, but realistic expectations. Initially I thought the sound was very good, but lacked low end and the highs sometimes a bit uncontrolled and bright. But this was using it with my notebook without an external DAC or amp. When connecting directly to my external Yamaha amp, resulted in a big improvement in overall sound quality, as well as helped with the lower end. The highs sometimes still sounded a bit bright to my liking. The set also handled loud volume better than I expected.

From the minute i put them on the comfort level amazed me..the plush super comfortable earpads combined with a super comfy padded headband...they are just lush in their comfort level...i can wear them for hours on end with ease..
Now the sound is what really got me...it is just so spot on...i am amazed at the open soundstage these produce for a closed back design..i didn't think it possible...it is honestly pretty wide...maybe not as expansive as my open back cans...but it comes very close..as i said it is a wide soundstage and i love a large immersion into the sound...
But equally amazing is the spot on precise stereo imaging...it is terrific..and the 50mm drivers are very responsive...rapid response..and accurate..no lag or muddiness...very nice tight..precise bass...very forward clear and beautiful mids..and crystal clear airy highs but no sibilance or shrillness...the sound these produce is simply...very pleasurable to expirience...
Yes there is definately something very special about these cb1 cans...status audio..i salute your team and their efforts...
You truly have produced a seriously great set of cans at a very affordable price....
These are easily as good as cans in the 200 dollar range....easily...

Thanks so much for these headphones...
I love them
Next im going to buy the status audio ob1 open back phones
Youre whole approach to producing great affordable headphones is to be commended..
And so is your care for your customers...i recieved an email from James Bertuzzi the owner of status audio...
I don't recall any personal touch and care like that from those higher end higher priced cans i own or their respective companies...

My go-to headphones had been the Sennheiser HD-202a remarkably good set of cans for $25 that hold their own against $40-50 units. The primary downside was (I thought) comfortthey were light, but not quite fully over-ear, with limited adjustment and a plastic headband. Music sounds pretty great through the 202s. I was also commuting with a set of $35 MPOW Bluetooth headphonesagain, sound that was just a notch below the 202s, but with the convenience of Bluetooth. They didn't fit me terribly well for long periods, but if I fiddled with them I could make them comfortable enough, and I had no complaints about the sound quality given the price point.

Then my CB-1s arrived as a birthday gift. I'm a changed man.

I ran a side-by-side listening test through a Behringer USB audio interface and headphone splitter, matching levels across the headphones.* All of a sudden the 202s, which I had thought were great for the money, sound like absolute piss. The CB-1 is in a different world. The soundstage is wide and detailed. The bass is tight and present,** the mids are crisp, the high end floats above without being harsh. A few listening notes:

- The 'Hamilton' cast album is a new record with the CB-1s. I put them on my daughter for Helpless/Satisfied, which she's listened to dozens of times. Her eyes got wide during the ""rewind"" transition, and hot damn the snare drum in Satisifed is even tighter than before. (I like 'Hamilton' as a test because it covers so much ground, from acoustic to electronic.)

- The new Sgt. Pepper's stereo mix is magical. Switch back and forth between the 2017 mix and 2009 remaster to fully appreciate what Giles Martin did with the source material.

- Acoustic material, like Flor De Toloache's 'Las Caras Lindas,' lets the transparency and openness (I know, that's an unlikely description for closed monitors) shine through.

- Crunchy compressed rock, like Beth Ditto's 'Fire,' really separates these from cheaper headphones. You can pick out individual instruments and vocal stylings in a way that get completely lost at a lower price point.

Finally, I know comfort and fit is a very personal thing, but these are easily the most comfortable headphones I've ever put on. (I'm 5'11"", with a somewhat small head.) They fit beautifully around my ears. The headband is light and as snug or loose as you want it. I have no doubt I'll wear these for long periods with no ear strain or discomfort.

* The CB-1s require more current to drive a similar volume than cheaper headphonesif you already listen at full volume on your cheap cans, you may be disappointed by the CB-1s, or need to invest in an amp.

** You may find the bass a little thin if you're used to ""extra bass"" headphones. These are flat studio monitors. EQ your device to taste if that's your thing.",5,0.78390305,0.006117058,0.063285439,0.049017014,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.132005331,Positive

The synthetic leather pads are legit THICC  I can have the headphones on for 12 hours without feeling their weight at all.

Sound quality is very crisp indeed and directional sound is well pronounced and noticeable in games or when using a 5.1/7.1 system. When it comes to quality overall I've had the Sony MDR-7506 and the Audio Technica m50x and I'm amazed how much value you get out of $79.

In the (abnormally quality) box you get a 3m. soft rubber, flexible cable and a coiled one, which you'll use more often if you usually connect to a laptop or phone, as well as a 1/4 adapter. All headers are gold plated and have a sturdy coiled wire extension so the cable doesn't bend and wear out.

8555,8564,B01BDX1IVW,A1CD7W4AHF4KGK,"I paid $79 via Amazon Smile 11 days ago and just received them today here in South Africa. I stumbled upon these and wasn't really looking for yet another pair of cans, but the promise of a half-decent pair of closed cans at this price intrigued me, to the point of going ahead of buying. All the 5-star reviews and the back story helped me decide as well.
I first tried to order from the manufacturer's site but during checkout realized that it only caters for US and Canadian buyers, or so it seems. So, searching I spotted that Amazon ships to my neck of the woods - and then ordered.
Got them this afternoon, very nicely presented in a sturdy no nonsense box.
Tried them with the fitted coiled cable and they are startled me - the first 5 minutes or so, they really did not sound coherent at all. Not sure why but that went away pretty quickly and now they sound like the 5 stars I have given them. To use the clich&eacute;: yes, the hype is all true.
The sound is very neutral, clarity and extension is very good. Pretty spacious sound. The earcups on mine is not built-up at the back of the ear like it is suggested on the promo pics, but fits just fine anyway. I do not think I have abnormally large ears and my ears barely makes it inside the cups, so larger ears may be a bit uncomfortable and require fitting after-market cups.
The fitted cable can be removed and I had to yank it quite firmly to get it out - maybe only the first time? Note: You need to turn the cable 90-degrees anti-clockwise with the dot in line with the cup, before you remove it. My V-moda cable fits quite nicely and sounds good too.
The original cables do not sound bad, I just prefer to use a softer cable.
There is some sound leakage, but not much at all. It is also very light and folds quite small for over-ear cans.

The only other closed over-ears I have had, was the Nad Viso HP50, which was nice, but I think the sound and spaciousness of the CB-1 is superior in every way. I have a few other cans (Philips SHP895, SHP9500, Fidelio X2 and had Sennheiser HD800, HD598, HD598SE, HD515, Audeze LCD-2 with Fazor and the Nad mentioned above) and can easily live with only the CB-1, if I had to. As seen from my peferences above and the ones that I have sold on again - I do not like headphones that are either uncomfortable and heavy (looking at you Audeze), or that needs a beefy external amp to get half decent sound (mostly looking here at Audeze, but Sennheiser as well).
Few people want to walk around with a source, amp and the cans - I know I certainly don't. If it doesn't sound good directly from my Apple iPad Air 2, LG V20 or Korg dacs, then I don't want it.
This is a solid 5-star product - for the price I paid and maybe even quite a bit more. Long lives Status Audio!",5,0.682759301,0.008817931,0.093268675,0.070804092,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.159374045,Positive

First impressions are pretty bad - the product arrives in a dodgy gold metallic-esq box with the headphones ina  cheap vacuum formed inner. Initially the band on the headphones creaked but with a little use this settled down.

What i like about this product is that all the money has been spent on the thing that matters most. These are a light comfortable incredible sounding pair of headphones. I traded up from a set of Sony monitor headphones and these headphones completely outstripped them, I do appreciate that they do not have any logos or branding on the headphones. I would highly recommend getting the extra cables if you intend to use these on the go.

The sound is very good - there's a nice broad/flat range of sound, decent soundstage, and there's nice isolation.  And, impedance is low enough that these can be driven with a cell phone or tablet.

Compared with the HD-1:  These are heavier, over ear rather than on ear, have more comfortable ear padding, and have a more flat, natural sound signature.
compared with OB-1 (open back):  Very similar, though the OB-1's have fixed cables on both ear cups.  Soundstage is more broad on the open model, bass is a bit better on the closed.

The flat sound profile took about a week to adjust to but they are great. Over the past year the sound quality and bass response have improved significantly. The cb1 by status audio provide the clarity of the mdr v6 with an enhanced bass response in a week. I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I'm a bit concerned about the plastic hinges and how well the comfortable ear pads will hold up but I would highly recommend these headphones as the best under $100 I've ever used.,5,0.640138048,0.010261159,0.105162109,0.082054546,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.3065,Positive

8636,8645,B01BDX1IVW,AFFJUKBAIPTJG,"I'm only a few days into ownership, but these are my favorite headphones so far.  I'm a software engineer, hobbyist musician, and general music-lover, so I've spent many an hour in headphones, ranging from ear buds to Sennheisers to Bose.  Suffice it to say these are my new go-to's for almost every single use.

- Sound isolation: these are reasonable, both in terms of external sounds coming through, and in terms of them bleeding sound out. They won't compare to active noice cancelling headphones, but that's not what you're buying these for, right?
- Comfort: the cups are perfectly sized and comfortable. No sweating or feelings of being ""squeezed"" after long periods of use. No ""fatigue"" noticed yet, either in terms of physical pressure or hearing-fatigue.
- Build quality: they feel pretty solid/heavy-duty. I haven't owned them for too long, but am not terribly worried about using them as daily drivers (with reasonable care applied).
- Cable quality: this is somewhat anecdotal, but every headphone I've plugged into my digital piano has had noise on the line - this is the first one that hasn't. It gives me confidence that other audio sources are also getting a cleanly-replicated signal to the headphones.
- ""Wow factor"" and other bonuses: multiple swappable cables come in handy. Screw-on jacks mean solid connections. Opening the box was on par with opening an Apple product. My one piece of feedback would be that the box might have been able to be a little smaller. A carrying case or pouch would also come in handy, but is not a requirement.
- Human factor: Status Audio has been a ""low-touch"" purchase process (a couple clicks on Amazon), but a ""high-touch"" post-purchase engagement making sure I'm happy with the product.  It's a company dedicated to high quality sound and user satisfaction as opposed to mass marketing or celebrity endorsements.

Last but not least, Sound Quality. It's hard to expand beyond what audiophiles and professional audio engineers have already said, but I'll agree with everyone.  The frequency response is about as neutral and unbiased as you can get, and listening has once again become a whole new experience. I actually get chills listening to orchestral scores or hearing nuances in other songs that I've never noticed before. Even solo instruments are a rediscovered thrill. In contrast to any worries about a weak bass response, these headphones drive a solid bass line that's even better because it's not overpowering and is ""as intended"" by the original recording.

All in all, fantastic headphones at an amazing price point, and would definitely recommend these to anyone interested in quality sound.",5,0.639833157,0.010442922,0.104708503,0.083233059,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.159629242,Positive

Watch his review.  He does a much better job showing how good these are than I could, it's the review that convinced me.

I will list just a few things that I really like about them though:

Comfort.  Most comfortable headphones I've used.  The earpads are really just perfect, they fit over the ears nicely and don't press against them at all.  The headband is good too, no discomfort after hours of use.

Looks/build quality.  These have a very minimal design, which I love.  They look great sitting in a clean/minimal PC desk set up.  Very sturdy feeling build as well, doesn't feel like they'll break when I take them off etc.  I think they'll last a very long time.

Finally, and most importantly, sound.  After owning cheap headphones my entire life, this is like stepping into a new world.  I'm not an audiophile, but to my ears, these have good highs, good mids, and excellent bass.  Hearing thunder in games on these is crazy.  It sounds real.

Honestly, I'm just glad I can wear it on my head and around my neck as well comfortably. All of my friends who have tried them some of them even professional musicians have been impressed by these.

The headphones are fairly lightweight but the construction is pretty good. I used them at my desk for a few hours with no noticeable ear fatigue, and the oversize ear cushions are quite comfortable. They fold up for storage and come with both a long straight 3.5mm ended cord and an optional spiral cord, as well as a standard 1/4 adapter for using with pro audio equipment. The packaging was nice and sturdy, but I do wish the manufacturer supplied a travel bag for the cans as well.

The sound on these is excellent for $80 headphones. I would rate them slightly better than my AKGs or the industry standard Sony MDR7506. The response was flat and perfect for mixing with equal temperament between lows, mids and highs. There is more bass present than with my AKGs but the bass does not seem to be boosted like you would find on consumer headphones such as Beats.

If you work in audio, these are a great find and worth the money for monitoring your mixes.

Edit: Sometimes the cord can become slightly unplugged from the left headphone bottom, resulting in muddy quiet sound. Check the cord before writing the headphones off as busted.

I didn't use them as much as I would like to have, because they weren't comfortable quite frankly. My ears would feel immense pressure after a short period of time. They sounded pretty decent but nothing compared to these CB-1s. A coworker has the Audio Technica ATH-M50x cans and swears by them. I was looking for a pair and started to do some research. I found articles talking about Status Audio and the CB-1s and continued to read more and more. I finally took the plunge and ordered a pair, if not for anything else to review and compare. I will say these have no chance of being returned. The value for the product is insane! You get two (well made) cables that detach from the headphone body, an extremely comfortable pair of headphones, and a 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter. The packaging is just enough to be professional yet frugal. It took me a few days to train my ear to this new level of sonic clarity, and at this point its hard to listen to anything through other headphones or in-ears. I would highly recommend these for anyone from casual listener to sound engineer and everything in-between.

I also bought a Bluetooth adapter at the same time. It would not fit these earphones until I used a grinder and shaved off the knurling on the Bluetooth connector so I could insert the connector into these earphones.  After that, they worked perfectly together.

I am very satisfied with these phones.  They suppress traffic sounds better than the ones that have active noise suppression.

They do not have a sound adjustment, but as the Bluetooth adapter does have a volume control as well as my phone this is not a problem.  In a studio, the volume could be controlled before it got to the earphones.",5,0.715409718,0.008263478,0.082666039,0.065876171,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.286666667,Positive

After that, I decided to do more research on headsets for my next purchase, but all recommendations pointed back to Status Audio.

The OB-1s were great. Superb sound quality (especially for the price), comfortable shape and design, and a sturdy frame.

I thought I should get the CB-1s for my next set since these don't leak sound like the OB-1s.

Even though I've heard that the leaked sound in the OB-1s is supposed to provide a better listening experience, I find that the CB-1s have comparable high-quality audio. However, in my opinion, the CB-1's foldable design suits my traveling needs more than the OB-1s, but both are excellent headsets.

They are ridiculously comfortable, too. I have a larger than average head and ears of equal proportion. The top band is nicely constructed. The ear pads are massive and comfy.

I use them for night time practicing with my amp, and have even used them on long phone calls so as to not have to hold my phone to my head. Comes with everything listed, and music sounds great through these. I would recommend to anyone looking for a quality pair of headphones at a fair price. Would buy again.

Will update after a month or two to report condition at that point. Feel free to ask me any questions!

UPDATE 10/16/17: Headphones are still 100% operational and sound amazing; I can't stress how good these things are for the price.

I am not an Audiophile but I really like the sound of the CB-1; It definitely outperforms my old HD280 pro and I enjoy them just as much as my HD600. Given that these are closed cans, I can take them to school and not worry about leakage (as long as you keep a reasonable volume level).

The headphone is efficient: the FiiO E10 has no problems driving the CB-1; I usually find that a volume level of 3~4 on the FiiO is enough for an enjoyable experience.

A bonus is the fact that the headphone cable is standard and detachable so you can upgrade in the future. I have been using the included coiled cable and it's been good so far. It is rather shameful that much more expensive headphones from other companies don't use standardized cables while a 80$ pair of headphones does.

But what's really striking is the sound quality. Very neutral, broad sound-stage for a closed-back system. Maybe this isn't the pair of headphones you want for walking down the street and listening to music from your phone (or maybe it is--I wouldn't know) but if you're working in a studio and need reference-quality sound, the CB-1 is very, very good.

And the kicker is the price point. You could easily spend $300 for comparable quality gear. A pair of headphones this good for $79 is just insane. Simply the best quality/price/value play on the market.

You simply can't get better comfort, sound, or aesthetics (obviously subjective) for this kind of money. The pictures surely don't do these pads justice, they're big fat pillows that swaddle your head. They have just the right amount of bass that doesn't overpower the mids and the highs are never fatiguing. Soundstage is surprisingly good, very wide for a closed set of cans (even better than some of my open headphones).

I may keep those home for now, these Status cans shred.  There is a surprisingly deep bass note for 15hz.  This set came with 2 cables, a short cable with a pig tail for extension and a longer straight cable.  The cables are of good quality and have strain reliefs.  Either cable has a notched cable end for plugging into the headphones (used for locking).  Works great, I do enjoy them quite a bit after warming them up for a full week.

**Updated review**

After about 5 months of normal use at work, the left channel is failing.  I cycled through cables and sources hoping it was either the cable or the amp but no, its this set of cans.  I'll be retiring these.  I realize $70 isn't a lot for headphones but I did expect more than 5 months use out of them. :/",5,1,1.85E-307,1.94E-306,1.49E-306,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.225,Positive

Over the past month or so I've purchased the philips shp9500s, the pioneer se-a1000s and the status cb-1. The ladder quickly rose to my favorite set. A lot of reviews out there make it seem like the bass is going to be lacking or flat. This is not the case. It is full and warm without muddying other tones or any negative effect really. Highs are crisp but not shrill at all. Mids are neutral. The super soft, thick leather pads filled with what I'm guessing is memory foam are so comfortable that after 5 minutes you forget they're there. This really is a great set at the price point.

Being a DJ and studio engineer, she asked me to look at the reviews and let her know what I think.

I told her the one thing I look for is frequency response, other than that, she'll need to test them out.

I was intrigued by the choice to deliver a flat sound instead of enhancing bass like the Beats.

After she received the headphones, I listened to them and was sold!  They sound great!  Awesomely clear!  The CB-1 headphones are comfortable for long periods of use.

I quickly decided to purchase a set myself.  I looked on Amazon, but was kinda miffed when I saw they were on backorder, but I said ""oh well, I can wait...they're worth it.""  a day or so later, I was pleasantly surprised by an email from Amazon saying my CB-1s will arrive six days earlier since they just go re-stocked!

I am glad I purchased the CB-1s and my daughter is happy her research inspired me.

The ""clamping force"" was so loose that they moved around on my head if I turned my head or looked up or down, to the point it felt like they would randomly fall off if I did anything other than sit perfectly still. There was also a gap between the bottoms of the ear pads and the area below my ears unless I wore them diagonally with the headband toward the back of my head.
Due to the fit, I sent them back and ordered a pair from a different manufacturer. I've owned several different kinds of headphones (I currently own 4) and have never had a problem with them being too loose to use like I did with these.

Another minor thing I noticed was that they felt kindof cheap and flimsy, in my personal opinion.

First impressions were very very good, I was thrilled with the headphones and at the price range they sound very good, but I must say there are alot of quality issues. I have been listening to these headphones for roughly 2 weeks and you can definitely notice that they skimped out on quality big time. At first I didn't think it was going to bother me to much ... but now it really does. The plastic that the headphones are made of seemed somewhat cheap, I say this because after the usage that I gave the headphones the right earcup makes a weird sound when I touch the earcup or move my head. The other thing that seemed out of the ordinary was the top portion of the headband, the stiching is coming off.

We were in the market for a decent pair of headphones, did a little research and heard about Status Audio. Boy, are we glad we bought these.....

Pro's:

Haven't heard music sound this good in years. Earbuds and cheap headphones do not compare. Sound bars miss a lot of the details.
Can't beat the quality of sound for the price. As long as you are not looking for huge bass, I think you will be hard pressed to find better  sound quality at anywhere near the price. Little carrying bag is nice. Box the headphones came in also looked good.

Con's:

These headphones are bulky. If you want to look cool walking down the street, look elsewhere. They do not fold as well as some other headphones I've seen. There is no hard case to protect when on the go or traveling. Sound does not get too loud, may not be what some are looking for.

8725,8737,B01BDX1IVW,A3O6UXU0YVGDVZ,"I had been hearing about these headphones for a while and finally decided to give them a shot. I own a few other pairs of fairly high end headphones so I'm pretty picky, but these still managed to surprise me. The sound is extremely clear and accurate, with nothing being overly emphasized. They have good, accurate bass, but they're not bass heavy, and the mid range sounds amazing. I've used them for movies, music, and gaming and they hold up equally well for each task. I think Status is aiming for these to compete with the ATH-M50's, and having owned both, I think I would actually go with these. They're way more comfortable and in my opinion the sound signature is just a little bit clearer and more neutral. The earcups are also really well cushioned and create a good seal around your head. Comfort is a really important factor for me and these are some of the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. I also found the noise isolation to be really good. They're not noise cancelling, but I would confidently use them on a commute or in a crowded office. There are a couple of minor downsides, however. One is the construction, as they sometimes feel a little cheap and you can hear some plastic creaking when you rotate the earcups, but I don't get the sense that they'll break easily, and I'm sure the cheaper materials are used as a way of keeping the cost down. Two, even though I found them to be very comfortable, I can see how the clamping force might bother some people after a while. I've felt much worse, but I can still see how it might bother someone. Three, both of the included cables are definitely meant for home use as they're quite long and the 3.5mm jack is rather large and probably wouldn't be easy to plug into a phone and travel with. I wish they would have included at least one cable that was a bit more mobile friendly. They do make them, but you have to buy them separately. Overall I'm extremely pleased with these, they're much better than a lot of headphones that cost twice as much.

These are definitely the best closed back headphones I've owned to date [you can just my head-fi username conquerator2 for a complete list of gear that I've owned and tried]. They are a bit V shaped, with a deep punchy bass response and a broader 5.5 - 7K treble rise but they aren't nearly as recessed in the midrange as most V shaped headphones. On the contrary, these headphones are surprisingly detailed, with very good soundstage and imaging and a surprisingly open sound, without hints of a closed-in feel, which closed back headphones usually have.

One major issue is that these bring out the flaws in any bad recording, and those can become quite un-fun to listen to. An amp smooths things over a bit. Not just that, these are very sensitive to different DACs. On my laptop's TRS they're a bit boomy. On my phone's TRS they're a bit sibilant. With my FiiO amp, they sound great. So... I think people getting these who want maximum enjoyment out of them should be prepared to drop some change on an amp of some kind if they don't have one and they have no good DACs on any of their devices. An amp makes the experience consistent across all devices.

2 - I cannot discern whether the pads are removable or not. I thought they were initially until I made an effort to take them off. Now I'm not so sure, and I'm too scared to try further. Fortunately they're comfy as it is.

Another note: these are the same as the Somic V1s. Status Audio seem to be a distributor for Somic, rather than an actual unique hardware company. You can look up the Somic reviews. The V1s got some praise on Head Fi. In general, they're great headphones. Status Audio, from what I've seen, is a much more reliable distributor than Somic, and I'd recommend getting these that way. People keep getting smashed boxes or headphones with a broken channel when they try to go through Somic for them. Status seem to be doing better quality control with the stuff going out, and I think that's what the price difference is mainly paying for. Nothing fun about getting new headphones only to realize you have to return them and wait another month.",5,0.6259221,0.010632583,0.109396316,0.085061942,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.223204792,Positive

Without a doubt these are the most comfortable headphones I have ever had on my head ever. As someone with a big head it was always a pain when my skull gets squeezed. Wing style headbands solve this but I hate how they feel as well. Status however not only puts the absolute most softest leather I have ever seen and felt on these headphones but they even make the headband soft leather as well. Great job Status Audio!

But how do they sound? Well they're studio headphones so yeah there isn't much bass and the lows are a little muted, but I care more about mids and highs which is where rock and metal primarily are in so they're perfect for me. But I EDM music is also pretty good on these as well. But for the bass heads and the rap lovers out there, these won't be the best ones for you. I've been using these as both music listeners and gaming headphones both on my PC and on my PS4 and I'm extremely impressed.

It changed the way i think that it has to be very expensive to be good. This one can easily beat a $400-$500 headphone.

Thank you Status Audio for delivering on your promises!

The sound quality of this pair of headphones is great and truly what I almost entirely expected out of Audio Technica ones. The mids are clear, the hights deliver a fantastic but not overdone sharpness and the bass is right there where you need it. Perfect for monitoring and listening to music!

Design-whise I love the minimalistic but not boring design approach. The materials feel high quality and sturdy - and my god these ear cups feel so dang comfy!)

Well, to all you audiophiles and even the avarage music guy out there:
Get yourself one of these headphones and convice yourself, because I simply can't think of another product like this for this uber low price tag!

8785,8799,B01BDX1IVW,A2R0YGIMTROGRZ,"I work at a decent size Jazz Venue. Being that I've gone through a good amount of cans and needed a new pair. I saw a review on YouTube and read a few good ones online. I needed a pair of Closed Back so I can, more or less, block out the live sound so I can mix the sound for the CD/Video recording without losing quality. I saw these were $80 and figured ""Hey, why not?""

Now for the actual review.
These are actually fairly light, but don't let that fool you. The detachable cord is nice, and I like the screw on 1/4"" adapt. Adjusting them to fit my is a tad bit hard. Its somewhat stiff to move, but I know it'll stay in place. They also have numbers on them so you can remember what number it is at which is awesome! I'm so used to remembering how many clicks I needed. Now I just need to look at the number.

For me, they fit perfectly. I'm used to cans either being too big or too small and being tight around my ears; these are perfect. Comfort. Amazing. Pillows around your ears.

And the quality is amazing! Everything is clear and cuts through. I don't need to struggle to hear certain instruments and frequencies.
I think one of my favorite things was the 2 cables and screw on 1/4"" adapter. Having it screw on I know it won't come off.
I personally use the coiled style cable. And I love the ""spring"" at the end to help against strain on the cable on awkward angles.

5/5 in my book. Amazing, comfortable and perfect! Going to invest in another pair of CB-1's and one or two OB-1's",5,0.709669245,0.008092675,0.085321391,0.064954482,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.300067275,Positive

8791,8805,B01BDX1IVW,AWN8AHWFD7C78,"Alright, so let me tell you a couple things.

I like Status Audio, I got some of the HD One headphones a while ago, and was blown away by the quality for the price. Same goes for these...
And then some.

These are the Status Audio CB-1 Headphones. Right out of the Amazon shipping box, you see the awesome packaging that Status Audio boxed this gift from the heavens inside. Flip it open, and you see the headphones in all their glory. They're amazing, hard to find words to describe them. They're incredible. These awesome over-ear cups, the padded head strap, it's more than comfortable. It's an experience, and one that I would happily keep having, and I'll keep these headphones, might even get more.

Sound, they've got that too. Sound great to me, get plenty loud, and they're built for amps and computers. Phones don't really provide enough power to get them really workin well, but that's alright. Two cords, one straight, one coiled, and I've got to say, the locking cable into the headphones, super fan of that. As well as the screw-on 1/4"" attachment. So many good things in these headphones, and for $80? Yeah, I'll do that any day.

I got these headphones before jumping on a plane, and while there's not active noise cancelling, they do a decent job of passive noise cancelling. Of course, if you crank the volume up, then you won't hear much of anything else, but if you're not inclined to do something like that, then you might be able to hear when someone is trying to get your attention. Not a big deal, for this price range of under $100, it's something I can live without.

Are you thinking of getting these headphones? Are you someone with ears? Do you want a pair of headphones that will forever change the way you look at headphones? Have you ever thought, 'wow, maybe if companies didn't spend so much money on advertising, and just put out a good product, would it be cheaper'? If you've ever thought anything like that, then get these headphones. If you've never thought something like that, then ask those questions and get these headphones.

I just don't know why they aren't already in your cart.",5,1,1.78E-307,1.90E-306,1.44E-306,4.405347594,112.2607884,0.362408685,Positive
8792,8806,B01BDX1IVW,A3S0QVZMWJE89X,"Wow..these are pretty amazing considering the value. Nice clear sound, comfortable, seem to be well built. Listen rock, classical, acoustic and some stuff that defies description, all sounds good, even my crappy home recordings. I listen through my computer and it all sounds great.
 I recently purchase a SainSonic 6J5 Class A Vacuum Tube Buffer Classic 47 Headphone Amplifier Decode Audio Hifi Diy Amp with Power Supply. This really makes the music sparkle. Do yourself a favor, don't follow the herd, don't pay too much. Get these headphones.

The outside sound rejection is very good, not noise cancelling but good enough to listen to music and decent levels and not have your roomies crappy taste in music bleed through.

8813,8827,B01BDX1IVW,AWCE198XGFL9G,"I wasn't going to write a review because other reviews here did a good job summing it up, but it's time to share my story with these...

I bought these 2 years ago. They felt cheap at first, which I thought was going to be a problem. It is a problem. There is a spring action swivel that limits the degrees it's able to turn. This has broke in the left ear cup and now it swivels freely and I can see the wires inside. I think I might accidentally twist the wires if I twist too far so I'll have to duct tape it in place. :\

Funnily enough I got a pair of OB-1's as a gift around the similar time and they also broke just recently as well. The earcup literally fell off on this one (but the cups are wired individually so they still produce sound). This says something about the build quality from this company overall I would say.

All in all, really nice headphones I really enjoyed them but they're gonna break at one point due to lackluster build quality. For the price though, I can't complain too much but it's a really feelsbadman kind of moment that I hope they address in future products. Seriously, I want to like Status! They've been good! However... I think I'm going to skip these and go for a more expensive and sturdier option for my next pair of closed monitors.

My only complaint is I had to soak the tube and mouthpiece in water for a while to get rid of the strong plastic taste.",5,0.326563608,0.004735767,0.058526202,0.038743396,4.6,27.95,0.138888889,Positive
8871,8885,B01DEQPD6C,A14A33TCJCLGNB,Came with both long and short mouth piece as  well as a instruction notebook that had the English translations from Japanese. The melodica its self is well made and sturdy and the added feature of a spit valve is awesome. Each white key is number and has solfeg on it. Middle C is also marked. Perfect fun little instrument for both experienced players and beginners. I highly recommend buying this one.,5,0.033625326,0.018400135,0.037222753,0.022794487,4.6,27.95,0.223035714,Positive
8872,8886,B01DEQPD6C,AWGQX8JY82MJL,"I had no problem with the bag. Once I got my Melodica, it rarely spends time in the bag. It is perfectly in tune with other instruments and after buying and trying this one, I ordered another so my friend and I can sit around and play duets, or accompany singers, and even play in a marching band (it's loud and high pitched enough to be heard over the noisy brass and drums!) You can't see it in the photos very well, but each white key has an embossed number, starting with 1 on C, 2 on D and so on, as well as solfegio (Do Re Mi) embossed markings. By holding the Melodica with the bottom on your lap or on a chair, you can play with both hands, left on the black keys, right on the white keys. Or lay it down on a table and play with both hands from the right side as if it is a tiny piano (using the hose for air - which, by the way, can be extended if necessary. But I soon got used to holding it with my left hand in the strap and playing with my right hand while looking down the keyboard at an angle - it's not that hard, just a new perspective to viewing a keyboard. No one ever mentions the spit valve, but there is one for when moisture from your breath builds up inside and has to be released. If you're a lap player, rest the bottom of the instrument on an absorbent pad, like a cloth pot holder.",5,0.041258207,0.03351522,0.043675671,0.027017621,4.6,27.95,0.080828785,Neutral
8873,8887,B01DEQPD6C,A2VL5IXDJPVAZW,"I like the sound I get out of it, and I enjoy it as an instrument thats like a keyboard, but easier to play due to the smaller range. Some of the notes are slightly out of tune, which doesnt bother me immensely, since its a cheap instrument, but other than that its a genuinely good product. Its also a good product for children since its so easy to use, and if they want to play a wind instrument at some point in their life, it can teach them about breath control and embouchure. As a trombone player, Im pretty good with both of those things, but I enjoy this instrument for its price and quality. Frankly, I think any musician would enjoy this instrument.",5,4.45E-306,1,4.75E-306,4.50E-306,4.6,27.95,0.291111111,Positive

I get about 4 months of usage before they start shorting out and eventually stop working altogether.  The price is affordable and they work well in the beginning but I have been unable to get one to last beyond 6 months.

CONS: the leathery parts are very cheap plastic material. Those parts are very susceptible to ripping and the plastic peels away easily. Very frustrating",6,0.622116126,0.004617229,0.085740946,0.043238256,4.4,11.49,0.185714286,Positive

9352,9367,B000XI6O2W,A34VV0DDR0OFE5,"This is the second one of these microphones that I've bought. I picked up one (same brand/model) last month at one of the local big box stores and it worked well enough that we wanted another one. We're not using them with a Singing Machine karaoke system, but rather a Pyle Home PT270AIU 300-Watt Stereo Receiver, which has two microphone inputs and allows you to sing/talk over whatever is playing. The two mics work reasonably well - given the system we're using them with. And considering these microphones themselves are pretty budget priced compared to professional grade equipment. Still, they are more than adequate since we're just playing around at home.

I like that the cords are ten feet long, that means we don't have to use extension cords. One thing that I might note, these mics are unidirectional, but you really need to hold the microphone close to your mouth and (this is important) sing/talk directly into the top of the microphone. The design of the mic inside the head is such that sounds coming into the sides doesn't reach the microphone (I unscrewed the head off one and discovered that).

All-in-all, these are decent enough given what they are selling for. I'm happy with my purchase.",6,0.085302968,0.014973764,0.059670718,0.056888812,4.4,11.49,0.166666667,Positive
