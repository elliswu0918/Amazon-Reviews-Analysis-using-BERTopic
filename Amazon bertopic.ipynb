I would not recommend the delux unless you are a musician whom plans on playing it often- There aren't any frets or anything indicating the notes on the instrument for any octave. However, you could use stickers as I have seen some do.\\nOverall, I enjoy the heck out of this guy and I even plugged it up to my amp and ran some effects through it making it sound even better!\\nKeep in mind, The sound alone is not very loud unless you plug it up to something.\",\n",

Is it there in case you use rechargeable batteries, or...? A bit useless if not. But still, not a big deal.\\nTo anyone who has just bought one and hasn't gotten it or opened it yet, use a coin to open the battery compartment. That confused me, too.\",\n",

If you get some vibrato in there, it can almost sound like a weird electric violin. As a cellist, I was able to pick this guy up and play some mostly-in-tune things, but if you're not a string musician, this will take time to master.\",\n",

It doesn't seem like it, but the deluxe version of the Otamatone is more than a toy; it's an actual, professional instrument. It can be difficult sometimes to play the exact note that you want, but you actually can produce specific notes on this. In case you're debating between the regular and the deluxe, having the three different octaves and the volume control are definitely good reasons to buy the deluxe. It's quiet enough to play at night without disturbing anyone, yet it can get fairly loud as well. Truly the most entertaining instrument that I've had the pleasure of playing.\\n\\nI was also impressed by the fact that I received it in less than 48 hours from the time I purchased it, since the seller I bought it from was only a few cities away from me.

I was actually not expecting it to be this thing, but its the size at which I can wear it like a damn saxophone. A beautifully annoying saxophone that belongs in an episode of Spongebob.\\nIt hits all the notes perfectly, and has a much better volume slider than its younger version, not to mention an aux jack.

There aren\\'t any frets along the neck like there are with guitars, so the best players are those with somewhat of an ear for music.

I personally treat it like a real instrument and treat it with love and care. Its hilarious to play it around others and they seem to have fun with it as well.

I was very impressed by the quality and at this price point it completely shines.\\n\\nI\\'ve been playing cello for a long time, sheesh 25 years now and I went to a violin shop to try bows. I ended up playing wood and carbon fiber and took a much more expensive carbon fiber bow to play/test. I liked it a lot but I am...er... budgety so I ordered this to be able to compare.\\n\\nThis bow has a darker, more muted sound than my wood bow, for sure. For me that was lovely and perfect, because my cello has a very bright resonance, which i love, and the... i wouldn\\'t even call it damping... the... darker overtones really worked nicely. In all honesty the tone was basically indistinguishable from the fancier (more expensive) carbon fiber bow I played. I even did semi-scientific recording tests to see if anyone could hear any difference at all. No difference in tone.\\n\\nThis bow feels chunkier (slightly heavy) but is by no means \"cheap\" heavy. It just isn\\'t an ultra lightweight bow. I have played ultra light weight bows... I don\\'t really like them. So, again, super subjective stuff here.\\n\\nLastly the hair is nice and thick and has a beautiful luscious sound, you get that classic very subtle whoosh sound when you change bow directions. I haven\\'t played with a fully haired bow in a long time so it has been heaven.\\n\\nOk actually lastly I play a lot a lot of the time and I semi-often play shows in loud venues. Certainly if you need a backup bow or a gig bow this will more than fit the bill. Having destroyed a couple bows playing in clubs when the monitor volume was too low (my rock gigs, not classical heh ;)  I can say this would hold up quite well (kind of a general statement re: carbon fiber). Oh and lastly this is a composite I believe, hence the extra weight (right?).\\n\\nAnyways. Good bow. Me like.',\n",

I did not expect to be able to notice much difference but even as a beginner this bow just feels nicer, the hairs are tighter and smoother, it grips the strings better, even feels better in my hand. I was hesitant to purchase a bow on line because all the advice seems to be, you need to feel out several to pick the best for your instrument. I've only been playing for a year, my instrument is just this side of shoddy and I'm not sure if I can muster the discipline to keep playing, nor will I probably ever have enough money for a legitimate cello even if I do keep improving, so for me, this was just right- obviously better than what I had (and better than I expected) without breaking the bank.\",\n",

Had to return it because it had cheap quality and thin bow hair.

For the price of re-hairing, less the hassle of travel time, wait time and still having a mediocre bow, I chose to buy a new bow within the same price range of re-hairing. I chose the Fiddlerman based on reviews, price and the description was well done. It weighs the same as my old bow, which was stated. (good call) It arrived promptly and I also had several emails before explaining how to rosin a new bow and some links for videos. The bow is very nice, handsome even and I'm very happy with it. My music teacher thought it was a good value for the price. Some day as I progress (I'm a beginner) I may want to upgrade my bow, but I feel for the next couple of years, this will be excellent. I even received an email concerning damaged rosin and where to contact them. My rosin arrived in perfect condition and I told them so. They responded a thank you for the response.

I also can not compare this to any other low price carbon fiber bow. I can compare it to my \"student/starter\" Brazilwood bow that came with my rental, and the only thing I can say is the makers of the brazil wood bow should be arrested for selling that as a cello bow. This bow is so far beyond that, even in my limited experience. It is smooth when pulled over the strings, and yet I can feel it grab. The tone is very full and mellow. I am extremely happy with this bow. My luthier wants me to try a JonPaul Avanti, and has ordered one for me to \"trial\". He believes I will be much happier with it. Well, it is going to have a high bar to compare to this Fiddlerman CF Bow.\\n\\nI have a blog where I am detailing my progress learning to play the cello and I will be posting a full detailed review of this bow within about a week.\\n\\nEDIT: I have been using this bow (and my new Codabow Diamond) for about a year now, and I have made a couple videos to show the to playing a simple study for comparison of tone. Tone is only one aspect of a bow, and is not enough to judge a bow, but the others articulation, balance, etc, are difficult to demonstrate and very personal.\\n\\nI am still very happy and can recommend this bow if you want an inexpensive bow to start with:',\n",
       " 'Well worth the price. The bow is light and bouncy and very responsive and produces rich and deep tones on all strings nice clean horse hair.  Came earlier than expected.

I may have to search for a second bow. However, the construction is good, the bow is straight, and the hairs don't fray easily. I want to also make note that they contacted me through email to give bow instructions and a how to guide for applying rosin. I'd like to give a 5 star rating but again, for carbon fiber, it really should be lighter.\",\n",

I immediately noticed a difference in tone and quality and what was even nicer was the advice received prior to delivery of how to rosin the bow on its arrival.  A great improvement to my ears and hopefully my teacher's.\",\n",
       " 'I am learning to play the electric cello on my own (never played a string instrument before) and purchased a medium price bow to replace the cheap one I got with the cello. It worked ok at first, but I was getting a funny flat \"rubbing sound\" most of the time no matter how I rosined the bow. I didn\\'t know if it was me or the bow so I purchased the Fiddlerman Carbon Fiber Bow to see if I could improve the sound. Fiddlerman sent me an email (before I even received the bow), totally unexpected but appreciated, with lots of information about their bows explaining that the bow would have to be rosined before playing. I followed their advice and carefully rosined the bow, and what a difference! Even to my untrained ear the sound is significantly better with no more \"rubbing sounds\". I\\'m sure a professional musician could find a better bow, but in my opinion, this bow produces great sound at a reasonable price for a beginner like me.',\n",

       " \"This is not a very good quality capo. It completely lacks any padding anywhere on the unit. This prevents the capo from getting a good grip on the strings and allows them to buzz. Not only that, but without any padding, you are clamping a capo on your instrument without any protection. This can scratch and scar your instrument, so if you have a dulcimer you've invested a lot of money into, this would not be a very good choice. Also, the part of the capo that connects with the adjustment screw is a piece of wood with no protection, simply applying the capo causes damage to the unit. I contacted the manufacturer the day I received the capo. They responded that they sell a lot of these and don't get complaints, but I don't see how that is possible. They refunded my money, but did not want me to send the capo back, which I found odd. I tried to use it a couple of times after this and it actually broke. I would say that if you're wanting a quality dulcimer capo, stay well clear of this item. I now have a Ron Ewing capo and love it. If you're looking for a good capo, do yourself a favor and go check out Ron Ewing's capos instead.\",\n",

There is bare wood - no rubber strip - on the bottom of the capo where it touches the strings; consequently, the capo does not properly bar the strings.  It looks nice in the picture, but it's basically worthless unless one wants to compeltely modify and remake it.\",\n",

Therefore, the string pressure necessary to prevent buzzes was not attainable, and the capo would not stay in place. . Also, the mechanism to tighten down the clamp.....the clamp design itself proved not to be stable. For these reasons, I suggest improvements on the clamp system....perhaps rubber inserts, metal plate to support the movable clamp, and the design of the string bridge to accommodate the gauge difference in the strings would make this capo a better product.......Sorry.....can't recommend this product at this time......\",\n",

Thankfully the product is wonderfully documented at Adafruit and it was very possibly the easiest portion of the project to do. We had it wired up to a simple push button that would play thunder and a separate Arduino controlled the lighting effects. The sound quality it is able to produce is absolutely astounding. I have a good deal of background in audio engineering and I was blown away at how clean the sound was. We used oog files for the audio and free online converters to get them to that format.

It requires a little soldering (own a solder iron) and a breadboard is a definite must, plus a few wires. But other than that, it is a stand-alone product. You can have fun with it without ever getting into Arduino.\\n\\n2) Sound quality is great considering the price and the USB interface to drop in sound files couldn\\'t be simpler.\\n\\n3) Finally, and this is important, keep in mind going into it that the trigger pins are actually \"outputs\" and not inputs.... the Vin and Gnd leads on the opposite, upper corner of the board need to be connected to between 3-5v, but after that, all that is required to trigger each sound file is to provide a wire connection it to the bottom GND pin below the trigger pins... I spent way to long trying to activate the sound files by APPLYING voltage to these pins as opposed to simply grounding them.... its a testament to Adafruit engineering I didn\\'t damage the thing.\\n\\nIn any case, highly recommended.',\n",

I\\'ve played at some pretty crazy places.\\nThe safety strap works, although I used to think it was a pain to hook it across.  Better to be safe than sorry.\\nThe stand has a broad enough stance and low center of gravity that make it pretty hard to knock over.\\nThe materials are of fine enough quality that I don\\'t worry about the finish being damaged on my instruments, the materials used for construction and the adjustable neck are sturdy enough to support any instrument I\\'ve ever had to use.\\nI\\'m sure there is going to be someone who doesn\\'t like something about this stand, but I\\'m not using this stand to jack up my car!\\nOn Stage also makes two other stands that hold multiple guitars.\\nI personally have no need for these stands but they are models GS7252B-DUO / GS7352B-TRI\\nThis is definitely a MUST HAVE FOR BEGINNERS and has proven itself in professional situations.\\nIt\\'s easy to assemble, it folds into a compact size and at $10.00 a stand, they are well worth the price.',\n",

The reason I did this is because while I think both guitar stands are very good, neither is perfect, and it is only natural to compare a new thing to the thing that you already have. But more importantly, it seems to me that these two stands are best suited for different purposes (more on this below). They are the CooCheer brand stand and the On Stage Stands brand. The CooCheer I just got from Amazon, the On Stage Stands I had already bought elsewhere.\\n\\nAlthough the video is the same video for both reviews, the following is the written review for the On Stage guitar stand.\\n\\nPROS:\\n*Sturdy build\\n*Folds down and can be dis-assembled into three smaller pieces\\n*Is a taller stand that provides support to both the body AND neck of the guitar\\n*Has a height adjustment\\n*Has a strap that will prevent the guitar from falling should someone accidentally bump into the guitar.\\n\\nCONS:\\n*The tripod design is mediocre in terms of stability. The base of this stand is not nearly as stable as the CooCheer design. If pushed hard enough this stand could fall over. I only keep mind against a wall.\\n*It does not fold down as small or cleanly as the CooCheer\\n*It is larger than the CooCheer when assembled and folded down.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that these two guitar stands are both very good, but they are each best suited to different uses. If you have a standard size 6-string electric or acoustic the CooCheer will work fine for you. If you have a longer/taller than typical 6-sting guitar, or particularly if you need a stand for a bass guitar (taller/longer), then you would be better served getting the On Stage Stands. The CooCheer seems like it would be very well suited for use at a gig or on tour, due to its light weight and the fact that it folds down so small. The On Stage Stands strikes me as something better suited for use in one\\'s home or studio, since it is larger, heavier, and the strap provides a little more protection to keep the guitar from falling over. So deciding which is \"better\" really depends on what you specifically need to use it for. For me, the ideal stand would have some of the traits of each of these. It would have the neck support and strap of the On Stage Stands, while having the more stable base of the CooCheer, and have the ability to fold down as small and cleanly as the Coocheer. Alas, since I don\\'t have the perfect stand I will happily use both of these as needed, for the situations each is best suited.',\n",

Its clear that On Stage just wanted to save money with that.  I thought at first I might have a defective unit, but according to all the product pictures this is the design.\\n\\nIts just an annoying slap in the face from a company that typically provides good quality, affordable accessories. You have to remember that even though the stand is only $12, its going to be used to secure guitars costing up to thousands of dollars.\\n\\nWill it fall over?\\nProbably not, but you should never have to worry about that regardless.\\n\\nFacepalm 8/10\\n\\nDont buy this for any reason.',\n",

I bought this as a \"very good condition\" used purchase, through Amazon, just to save a couple of dollars, and I made a mistake.  It\\'s messed-up.  It looks fine, but it has a severe flaw.  Either it was manufactured incorrectly, or whomever returned it (most likely) stepped on the front legs, or something, because the upright part is almost perfectly vertical, and the bottom holder bars practically tilt downwards, which means if I put my guitar all the way in, it will fall out.  I\\'ve got another guitar on it now, but a had to put it in at an angle.  There\\'s no top strap to lock-in the neck, either.  I really was not paying attention.  I threw away the box it came in, too.  Amazon might still take it back, but then I\\'d have to find a good sized box, probably pay for shipping, etc.  Pita.  I\\'m going to see if I can bend it back into usable shape.  Fwiw, I do own 4 others of these, that I bought brand new, and they\\'re all fine.  I had previously given this item 5 stars, which a brand new one, manufactured properly, would deserve.  Btw, one newbie mistake people make with this is that the legs have to lock into place.  You have to exert some force to do this, and if you don\\'t, the stand will lean wrong, and be unstable, so if you have one, and have this issue, first make sure the legs are clicked-in all the way.

I like to hang the shoulder strap on the neck yoke, as well as a small drawstring bag for tuner, finger picks, capo, etc. These hang discreetly behind the neck of the banjo and barely show. Please keep in mind that the banjo I am using is the small beginner kind with an open back (pics attached)--a standard banjo is much heavier, but I think it should still be fine, as the angle of the stand isn't too steep.
