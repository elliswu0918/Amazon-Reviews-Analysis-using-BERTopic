       "[\"I'm only a novice so my experience with bows is quite limited, however, this bow is great compared to the bow my cheap cello kit came with. I did not expect to be able to notice much difference but even as a beginner this bow just feels nicer, the hairs are tighter and smoother, it grips the strings better, even feels better in my hand. I was hesitant to purchase a bow on line because all the advice seems to be, you need to feel out several to pick the best for your instrument. I've only been playing for a year, my instrument is just this side of shoddy and I'm not sure if I can muster the discipline to keep playing, nor will I probably ever have enough money for a legitimate cello even if I do keep improving, so for me, this was just right- obviously better than what I had (and better than I expected) without breaking the bank.\",\n",
       " 'This is an excellent cello bow.  Very fine design, balanced weighting, easy to hold and bow with.  Highly recommended.',\n",
       " \"My son loves this bow.  It's his 3rd Fiddlerman Carbon Fiber bow (2 violins and 1 cello) and he is very pleased.\",\n",
       " \"This bow was recommended to me by a cello teacher. She was right. It's a great value and a big improvement over the bow that was included with my medium priced Chinese cello.\",\n",
       " 'This bow is really great for the price!! I tried some other bows (blind test) from amazon that were similar in price and I picked this one every time.  It has lots of power and works well for many different bowing styles.  I have played over 30 years and would be able to play with this bow for performances if I needed too.  Yes I do prefer my more expensive wooden bow, but this is a nice second bow to have in my case.',\n",
       " \"Definitely a beginner level bow, titled as carbon fiber but is actually carbon fiber composite (read the product description carefully). Had to return it because it had cheap quality and thin bow hair. If you plan to play cello for quite some time, I recommend investing in a hybrid or carbon fiber bow that's at least in the 200~300 range.<br /><br />Perhaps the best bow you can get for under $100, but you get what you pay for.\",\n",
       " \"So far, this cello bow is performing better than expected.  I like the light feel of it.  The only thing that's a potential problem is that the bow hair seems to be thinner than expected, and loose.  Quite a few hairs have come loose and had to be pulled.  It's too soon to give a complete review of the bow.\",\n",
       " \"I am a beginning cellist. I purchased this based on the outstanding Amazon reviews. I personally didn't feel it was any better than the fiberglass bow my cello came with. I contacted Michael at Fiddlerman and he very graciously sent me a braided carbon fiber bow that is not listed on Amazon to try since I was looking for something lighter (the regular carbon fiber bow weighed 82 grams, the braided was 77). I am VERY happy with the braided carbon fiber bow. If you are looking for a carbon fiber bow, recommend contacting Michael and asking about pricing for the braided carbon fiber.\",\n",
       " 'I used this bow for 4 weeks, and I can say it is a fine FIRST bow, especially considering the insane cost of better bows.  It\\'s heavy as bows go.  The fiberglass stick has plenty of spring once tensioned.  The hair is fine quality Siberian.  It should be good for your first year or longer.  BUT :: this is essentially a disposable bow.  Re-hairing needs to be done by a professional, and that costs more than the bow.  So when it needs re-hairing, you toss it and buy a new, or better, one.  Now that I know more, I would have bought a Fiddlerman \"Forever\" Vegan bow because the synthetic hair lasts \"forever\".  All that said, I have already upgraded to a P&H Carbon Fiber Bow from England that can be re-haired by the owner for $12.  Go in peace good people - and play more cello !!!<br /><br />UPDATE :: I have been playing this bow quite a bit and comparing it to my P&H carbon fiber bow.  I took off 2 stars because I find this bow requires a lot more work to get good smooth tones.  It\\'s also harder to prevent it from wandering.  It may still be a good FIRST bow, but you\\'ll discover this bow\\'s limitations very soon in your learning process.',\n",
       " 'Great bow for a great price!',\n",

       " \"Adult rookie cello player.  This is the third bow I've played with, and the first carbon bow.  Control and tone are much better than with the other two bows, one of which is a nice pernambuco.\",\n",
       " 'Perfect for my beginning cellist. Delivery was fast and the bow was exactly as described. Bonus was getting an email with the You Tube links!',\n",
       " 'Love this bow! Ideally, I’d get to test out a bow in a shop before purchasing, but we don’t have a strings shop in my town. I took a risk with ordering this bow, but felt comforted knowing I could return it. It arrived so nicely packaged. The first time I played my cello with it, I was sold. The weight is just right, the balance is good, and it feels good in my hand. My instructor, a professional cellist, tested it out and was very pleased with it as well. That gave me the extra confidence to know I made a good purchase.',\n",
       " 'just what we needed, good quality, arrived quickly, my high school cello playing daughter is very happy now!',\n",
       " \"It's been a good bow. Honestly though, it's heavy compared to some other bows I've used. For me personally, weight tires me out more since I'm pretty dainty and new at this. I may have to search for a second bow. However, the construction is good, the bow is straight, and the hairs don't fray easily. I want to also make note that they contacted me through email to give bow instructions and a how to guide for applying rosin. I'd like to give a 5 star rating but again, for carbon fiber, it really should be lighter.\",\n",
       " \"Impressed a young lady who is not easily impressed.  I'm not the musician, but if she is happy so am I.\",\n",
       " 'I own a $400 dollar bow and I would say that this bow feels and performs on a very similar par. All my earthly belongings, including cello and bow, are in a storage for who knows how long. Well, I couldn\\'t just be \"cello-less\" for a whole year. I ended up buying a used student cello on craigslist and putting good strings on it and researched this bow. And wow! This cello sounds almost as good as my higher end student cello... and having a good bow and good strings makes all the difference. For the price this is it. This is the one!!',\n",
       " 'Well worth the price. The bow is light and bouncy and very responsive and produces rich and deep tones on all strings nice clean horse hair.  Came earlier than expected.Mush better than the Brazil Wood  I had before. It took the rosen well and I was very pleased with it from the first time I played it. I would Highly recommend it for any level.',\n",
       " 'A great cello bow, I’ve played for 10 years and it is one of the better ones I’ve used. Only critique is that it does not hold even premium rosin well',\n",
       " 'Beautifully crafted with excellent craftsmanship. Takes rosin well, (about 10 mins initially, with only a few strokes to top up, after), and provides plenty of grip on the strings. This means getting sound from the strings is easier, and doesnt require much weight on them. My daughter loves it. Oh, and it sounds fantastic.',\n",
       " \"I do love this bow. I was very impressed by the quality and at this price point it completely shines.<br /><br />I've been playing cello for a long time, sheesh 25 years now and I went to a violin shop to try bows. I ended up playing wood and carbon fiber and took a much more expensive carbon fiber bow to play/test. I liked it a lot but I am...er... budgety so I ordered this to be able to compare.<br /><br />This bow has a darker, more muted sound than my wood bow, for sure. For me that was lovely and perfect, because my cello has a very bright resonance, which i love, and the... i wouldn't even call it damping... the... darker overtones really worked nicely. In all honesty the tone was basically indistinguishable from the fancier (more expensive) carbon fiber bow I played. I even did semi-scientific recording tests to see if anyone could hear any difference at all. No difference in tone.<br /><br />This bow feels chunkier (slightly heavy) but is by no means &#34;cheap&#34; heavy. It just isn't an ultra lightweight bow. I have played ultra light weight bows... I don't really like them. So, again, super subjective stuff here.<br /><br />Lastly the hair is nice and thick and has a beautiful luscious sound, you get that classic very subtle whoosh sound when you change bow directions. I haven't played with a fully haired bow in a long time so it has been heaven.<br /><br />Ok actually lastly I play a lot a lot of the time and I semi-often play shows in loud venues. Certainly if you need a backup bow or a gig bow this will more than fit the bill. Having destroyed a couple bows playing in clubs when the monitor volume was too low (my rock gigs, not classical heh ;)  I can say this would hold up quite well (kind of a general statement re: carbon fiber). Oh and lastly this is a composite I believe, hence the extra weight (right?).<br /><br />Anyways. Good bow. Me like.\",\n",
       " 'Love my new bow! It is easier to play than my last bow. Thank you so much for offering a quality product at a reasonable price.',\n",
       " 'Ive been playing the cello for years. The control and balance of this bow is surprising for the cost.',\n",
       " \"Over all, this is a very nice bow.  It's a little heavier and less responsive than the bow I've used for the past 35 years, but that one was recently appraised at several thousands of dollars, not $80! We purchased this bow for my husband who is taking up cello as an adult, and it definitely meets his needs. When he has been playing for a while, and can actually judge how a bow responds to his style, we might look at getting him a wood one or a lighter carbon fiber one. For now, it will serve him well for at least a couple years, if not become his lifetime bow. Certainly can't complain about the cost! Perfect for beginners, or even as a step up bow, or one to take to summer pops concerts on those blistering hot afternoons when you just don't want to fry your good bow. We didn't try any of the other carbon fiber bows, so I can't say if another $300-500 would have made a big difference, but I can't imagine for a beginner or even an intermediate player it would.\",\n",
       " 'our grandson will enjoy it.',\n",
       " 'Pretty good bow honestly. Paired with the “Prelude” strings it’s a pretty good combo. Do NOT skimp on strings. Cheap strings will make a great cello sound terrible, but good strings can make a terrible cello sound pretty good. The bow feels pretty high quality, but it’ll take a while to break in. Keep that in mind.',\n",
       " \"Bow is light and comfortable, sound is good -- I'm happy with this purchase.\",\n",
       " \"I'm very pleased with the bow and the quality of the hair.  And such an affordable price for the quality.\",\n",
       " 'I am just starting to learn cello - I am 66 and retired and I started 3 months ago, so I have limited experience to compare to this. I also can not compare this to any other low price carbon fiber bow. I can compare it to my &#34;student/starter&#34; Brazilwood bow that came with my rental, and the only thing I can say is the makers of the brazil wood bow should be arrested for selling that as a cello bow. This bow is so far beyond that, even in my limited experience. It is smooth when pulled over the strings, and yet I can feel it grab. The tone is very full and mellow. I am extremely happy with this bow. My luthier wants me to try a JonPaul Avanti, and has ordered one for me to &#34;trial&#34;. He believes I will be much happier with it. Well, it is going to have a high bar to compare to this Fiddlerman CF Bow.<br /><br />I have a blog where I am detailing my progress learning to play the cello and I will be posting a full detailed review of this bow within about a week.<br /><br />EDIT: I have been using this bow (and my new Codabow Diamond) for about a year now, and I have made a couple videos to show the to playing a simple study for comparison of tone. Tone is only one aspect of a bow, and is not enough to judge a bow, but the others articulation, balance, etc, are difficult to demonstrate and very personal.<br /><br />I am still very happy and can recommend this bow if you want an inexpensive bow to start with:',\n",

It worked ok at first, but I was getting a funny flat &#34;rubbing sound&#34; most of the time no matter how I rosined the bow. I didn't know if it was me or the bow so I purchased the Fiddlerman Carbon Fiber Bow to see if I could improve the sound. Fiddlerman sent me an email (before I even received the bow), totally unexpected but appreciated, with lots of information about their bows explaining that the bow would have to be rosined before playing. I followed their advice and carefully rosined the bow, and what a difference! Even to my untrained ear the sound is significantly better with no more &#34;rubbing sounds&#34;. I'm sure a professional musician could find a better bow, but in my opinion, this bow produces great sound at a reasonable price for a beginner like me.\",\n",

       " 'I had the bow for a week by now. It is easy to play with warm sound. The quality of the bow is good for its price. No complaint. However, I need to point out two characteristics of the bow that may influence your purchasing decision. First of all, it is a bit on the heavy side. The bow I got weights 82 gram. The balance point is a bit further toward the tip. Also, the bow is more flexible than my current bow. I feel it is more bouncy and I have the tendency to over-tighten the hair to get the tension I like.<br /><br />I contacted the seller. Alex from the Fiddlerman gladly offered me a free return and exchange for a new weaved bow. The weave bow is a new product. It should weigh 80 gram and is stiffer. I only have to pay for the price difference between the two products. Excellent service from the Fiddlerman! Highly recommended.',\n",

For the price of re-hairing, less the hassle of travel time, wait time and still having a mediocre bow, I chose to buy a new bow within the same price range of re-hairing. I chose the Fiddlerman based on reviews, price and the description was well done. It weighs the same as my old bow, which was stated. (good call) It arrived promptly and I also had several emails before explaining how to rosin a new bow and some links for videos. The bow is very nice, handsome even and I'm very happy with it. My music teacher thought it was a good value for the price. Some day as I progress (I'm a beginner) I may want to upgrade my bow, but I feel for the next couple of years, this will be excellent. I even received an email concerning damaged rosin and where to contact them. My rosin arrived in perfect condition and I told them so. They responded a thank you for the response.

The hair length is perfect (just a few mm between frog and pad when at a tension I find comfortable), the bow seems moderately well-balanced, and the mother of pearl-look inlays on the frog are a nice touch. But! The adhesive the pad was secured to the stick with was hastily applied and there is glue leaking out of both ends of the pad. Not the end of the world - except it becomes sticky when you rest your thumb on it. Further, The winding is covered by a plastic wrapper that has trapped some of this glue underneath it along with dirt or dust, giving an otherwise elegant bow a sloppy, cheap appearance.<br /><br />I really want to love this bow, but it’s really disheartening to see what should be a great bow marred by careless finishings.',\n",

This can scratch and scar your instrument, so if you have a dulcimer you've invested a lot of money into, this would not be a very good choice.

My original stand had a good one.  My second stand had a less-good one which broke.  My three new ones, one has the same good one as my first, another the not as good one as my second, and the last one has another entirely that is really difficult to pull across and attach (and will probably break).<br /><br />I don't like this.  Please standardize your product.  I want them all to be good like my first one, not like my broken one, and I don't want the new ones I just purchased to break.  It's a real shame.

If you want something more stable, get a Hercules (I've used one for weekly gigging for over ten years. It's battered and bruised, but still works) or Ultimate.

I bought this as a &#34;very good condition&#34; used purchase, through Amazon, just to save a couple of dollars, and I made a mistake.  It's messed-up.  It looks fine, but it has a severe flaw.  Either it was manufactured incorrectly, or whomever returned it (most likely) stepped on the front legs, or something, because the upright part is almost perfectly vertical, and the bottom holder bars practically tilt downwards, which means if I put my guitar all the way in, it will fall out.  I've got another guitar on it now, but a had to put it in at an angle.  There's no top strap to lock-in the neck, either.  I really was not paying attention.  I threw away the box it came in, too.  Amazon might still take it back, but then I'd have to find a good sized box, probably pay for shipping, etc.  Pita.  I'm going to see if I can bend it back into usable shape.  Fwiw, I do own 4 others of these, that I bought brand new, and they're all fine.  I had previously given this item 5 stars, which a brand new one, manufactured properly, would deserve.  Btw, one newbie mistake people make with this is that the legs have to lock into place.  You have to exert some force to do this, and if you don't, the stand will lean wrong, and be unstable, so if you have one, and have this issue, first make sure the legs are clicked-in all the way.

The height of the neck from the swivel base (not the floor) is adjustable from 21&#34; up to about 26&#34; (and still able to use the screw in the back to secure the adjustable neck). The pictures are exactly what you get, so I didn't see the point of taking another picture of the stand.<br /><br />The two issues I have with this stand is 1. It is in fact very unstable. While it's just sitting around, it's nice and as long as it is out of the way then it's fine. If you barely push it diagonally to the back left or back right, it will easily fall over. If it is sitting in a corner you wont have to worry about it. If it is on a stage, in a more high traffic area, or if there are other items around that could push in to it or if you're in a rush to put it down, dog/kids in house - it could easily fall over. I have mine in a corner like most people probably do, however that's a major concern for a stand. The rear peg is just too short. 2. The pads on the metal aren't very high quality. Although they are fine for light use around the house and will probably last a year or more, they will wear out and need to be replaced for sure. They are not very thick but do the job.<br /><br />I really debated on giving it three stars, but for how I'm using it (in home only) and the price, I believe it rated 4 stars.

I bought the stand for use in my house because I was leaning my guitars against the walls and they'd always somehow fall over and get scratched or hit something... so if you're wanting it for gigs, I can't tell you how well it'd work for on-stage... but my guess is that it'd be fine. :)\",\n",

It\\'s fairly easy to push the thing over backwards without a lot of effort.  I\\'m no engineer, but the rear leg of this one is definitely shorter than my other ones which are about 6 to 6 1/2\" long and this one is only about 3 to 3 1/2\" long.

They have been leaning against the wall, shoved under the couch, hanging on top of the tv stand, etc. Finally I realized enough is enough and wanted to get a stand to store them prior to their ritual Friday night usage.<br /><br />For this task, I decided to try the On Stage XCG4 Tubular Guitar Stand. Also, yes, I do have a fender guitar in my bedroom that also requires a stand and, before moving onto my baby, I first wanted a subject to test the stand on.<br /><br />For starters, this stand is priced at a very reasonable rate which is very helpful in todays horrible economy. It did not take much energy to convince the wife to loan me the money to purchase this item.<br /><br />The stand was very simple to extend and put together. The legs fold and so, when putting together, make sure you snap them into place or else the stand itself will not be stable. The top tube inserts into the bottom tube and a nut in the back is what holds it into place. Also, this will allow you to adjust the height on the top of the cradle for proper placement. The cradle of the stand itself swivels. This helps in making sure that your guitar properly settles into the cradle safely and securely. There is also a rubber security band on the top tube that holds the neck of the guitar. This is a nice feature to make sure your guitar does not fall out in case the stand is forced to lean forward such as being bumped or, if you carry the stand with guitar in place, it will stay put during transportation.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful purchase. It is a very affordable well built product. Recommended to hold your guitar, let it be the real deal or your collection of guitar hero guitars.',\n",
